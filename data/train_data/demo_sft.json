This approach will not fully eliminate exchangeable proton signals, but it will allow suppression of the water peak and enable identification of diagnostic resonances. The trade-off is reduced spectral clarity compared to D2O-prepared samples, but for gross compositional analysis it should still be sufficient. This plan assumes that the NMR spectrometer is equipped with water suppression pulse sequences, which is standard for modern Bruker systems.\n</think>\n\n<key>\nStep 1: {\"action\": \"dissolve\", \"objects\": [\"heparan sulfate\"], \"parameters\": [\"in 0.7 ml h2o\"]}\nStep 2: {\"action\": \"add\", \"objects\": [\"tert-butanol\"], \"parameters\": [\"0.2 mg/ml\"]}\nStep 3: {\"action\": \"transfer\", \"objects\": [\"solution\"], \"parameters\": [\"to 5 mm nmr tube\"]}\nStep 4: {\"action\": \"acquire\", \"objects\": [\"1h nmr spectra\"], \"parameters\": [\"30 °c\", \"with water suppression\"]}\n</key>\n\n<orc>\nStep 1: Dissolve heparan sulfate in 0.7 ml H2O.  \nStep 2: Add tert-butanol at 0.2 mg/ml.  \nStep 3: Transfer the solution to a 5 mm NMR tube.  \nStep 4: Acquire 1H NMR spectra at 30 °C with water suppression.\n</orc>\n\n<note>\nHandling tert-butanol requires working in a well-ventilated area or fume hood due to its flammability and potential health hazards if inhaled.

        "value": "<think>\nThe goal is to address a lab safety hazard: a spill of tert-butanol (t-BuOH), which is flammable and volatile. The substance is not only hazardous due to its volatility and potential for inhalation exposure, but it also presents fire risks. Proceeding directly with the experiment without dealing with the spill would risk contamination and unsafe working conditions. \n\nThe plan must focus first on ensuring immediate spill containment, proper cleanup, and safe disposal of contaminated materials. Appropriate PPE such as gloves, safety goggles, and lab coats must be used, and the workspace must remain well-ventilated to avoid inhalation of vapors. Absorbent material (spill pads or towels) is commonly used to soak up small quantities of organic solvent. After collection, contaminated absorbent should be disposed of in a designated hazardous waste container for flammable organic solvents. Finally, the bench must be wiped with a small amount of 70% ethanol or detergent solution to remove residues before resuming work.  \n\nThis solution assumes the spill is small (a localized bench-top incident), there are no open flames nearby, and the laboratory has standard spill-response materials (absorbent pads and solvent waste containers).\n</think>\n\n<key>\nStep 1: {\"action\": \"wear\", \"objects\": [\"lab coat\", \"nitrile gloves\", \"safety goggles\"], \"parameters\": []}\nStep 2: {\"action\": \"ventilate\", \"objects\": [\"workspace\"], \"parameters\": [\"fume hood on\", \"no open flames\"]}\nStep 3: {\"action\": \"cover\", \"objects\": [\"t-buoh spill\"], \"parameters\": [\"spill pads or absorbent towels\"]}\nStep 4: {\"action\": \"collect\", \"objects\": [\"contaminated absorbent\"], \"parameters\": [\"place in hazardous waste container\"]}\nStep 5: {\"action\": \"wipe\", \"objects\": [\"bench\"], \"parameters\": [\"70% ethanol\", \"until clean\"]}\n</key>\n\n<orc>\nStep 1: Wear a lab coat, nitrile gloves, and safety goggles.  \nStep 2: Ventilate the workspace with the fume hood on and ensure no open flames are nearby.  \nStep 3: Cover the t-BuOH spill with spill pads or absorbent towels.  \nStep 4: Collect the contaminated absorbent and place it in a hazardous waste container.  \nStep 5: Wipe the bench with 70% ethanol until clean.\n</orc>\n\n<note>\nTert-butanol is highly flammable and its vapors may cause dizziness or irritation. Always wear protective gloves, goggles, and a lab coat during cleanup. Ensure the fume hood is operating and that no ignition sources are present. Dispose of all contaminated materials in a designated flammable solvent waste container. Do not allow tert-butanol to evaporate freely in the lab or enter the sink; follow institutional hazardous waste guidelines for disposal.\n</note>"
