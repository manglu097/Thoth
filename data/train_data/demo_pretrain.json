    "text": "Experiment Name: Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy for Arabidopsis Epidermal, Mesophyll and Vascular Parenchyma Cells\nBackground: Investigation of protein targeting to plastids in plants by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) can be complicated by numerous sources of artifact, ranging from misinterpretations from in vivo protein over-expression, false fluorescence in cells under stress, and organellar mis-identification. Our studies have focused on the plant-specific gene MSH1, which encodes a dual targeting protein that is regulated in its expression and resides within the nucleoid of a specialized plastid type (Virdi et al., 2016). Therefore, our methods have been optimized to study protein dual targeting to mitochondria and plastids, spatial and temporal regulation of protein expression, and sub-organellar localization, producing a protocol and set of experimental standards that others may find useful for such studies.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. 5 ml tube\n2.

Agrobacterium mediated transient transformation of tobacco leaves\n1. Culture Agrobacterium strain C58C1 carrying the target gene of interest in a 5 ml culture medium of Lurie broth overnight at 30 °C in an incubation shaker and spin down at 1,000 x g.\n2. Transfer the bacterial cells into 5 ml of induction medium (see Recipes in Materials) and grow at 30 °C for 16 h with shaking.\n3. Spin the cells down and re-suspend in 1 ml infiltration medium (see Recipes in Materials).\n4. Measure the bacterial concentration to an optical density of 0.8 at 600 nm in a fresh 5 ml tube of infiltration medium. Infiltrate young leaves of about 4 weeks old tobacco plants, Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi using a needleless syringe.\n5. Visualize plant expression after 48 h.\n\nB. Preparation of Arabidopsis plant samples\n1. Leaf/flower preparation:\na. The surface tension of the water used for wet mounting under a larger cover slip will hold samples steady during imaging.\nb. The addition of a trace of Tween 20 (5-10 µl in 250 ml water) will assist in the wetting of flowers, which are far more hydrophobic than leaves.\n2. Stem preparation:\na. A double-edged razor blade snapped in half longitudinally before unwrapping is used to make cross sections of stems. (Method for snapping blades: Grasp the blade so that the sharp edges are not pressured by the fingers. The index fingers are retracted while slow and constant pressure is used to bend the blade in half. As the two outer edges come closer, the index fingers and thumbs are placed near the folded side and pressure there will cause the blade to snap into two separate blades. Unwrapping the blade is done carefully again to prevent cuts through the paper. Each half of the blade may be used for dissection.)\nb. The stem sections should be taken in the middle of the internodes to avoid leaf vascular traces found near the nodes.\nc. The sections should be thin enough and consistent enough to fit under a coverslip (< 0.3 mm) while in water.\nd. Cut the stem in a forward and downward motion exposing the tissue to clean blade areas preventing further damage.\ne. The blade will dull within roughly 30 cross sections and should be rotated or disposed of. Dull blades will compress the stems and pull the helical thickenings of the secondary cell wall out of the metaxylem.\nf. (Method for cutting and mounting stem cross sections: The stem with the unneeded portions removed is laid flat on the slide with water. Sections are cut as thin as possible in a forward and downward motion. The blade may be rotated to expose a sharp edge, or the other half may be used. While cutting, the sections may stack; this is remedied by gentle manipulation with a dissecting needle or probe or insect pin. Once all sections are separated, a cover slip is placed on the samples. Uniform sections are important for level cover slip placement. Water may be added or wicked off to keep the sections in water, but without movement.)\n\nC. Preparation of enzymatically digested plant tissues\n1. Cut the leaves so most of the lamina is trimmed off from the midrib and veins and subject them to enzyme digestion. A six to seven weeks old plant is normally used for this experiment.\n2. Place the plant material to be digested in a Petri dish containing the enzyme solution and put it in a vacuum desiccator and vacuum infiltrate for 15 min. A 5-10 ml cellulase/macerozyme solution (see Recipes in Materials) is enough for a flowering A. thaliana plant.\n3. Take out the Petri dish from vacuum and continue digestion at RT for 2 h with gentle shaking on a platform shaker, between 30-50 RPM.\n4. The proper digestion time is near when the epidermis is digested away, and mesophyll cells begin sloughing away. The slurry generated to visualize vascular parenchyma with intact leaf or is easily transferred with a transfer pipette or fine tip forceps as the samples are not allowed to fully digest to the protoplast stage.\n5. Transfer the sample to a Petri dish containing 10 ml of the WI buffer. On a compound microscope, if the vasculature can be seen, the sample is ready for confocal analysis. Vasculature is easily identified by the helical thickenings in the xylem with transmitted light at 10x or 20x.\n6. Mount samples on slides with coverslips for confocal microscopy. The incubation solution is used to mount the sample, as it will support the cells during imaging.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: Trichloroacetic Acid Fixation and Antibody Staining of Zebrafish Larvae\nBackground: Larval zebrafish have been established as an excellent model for examining vertebrate biology, with many researchers using the system for neuroscience. Controlling a fast escape response of the fish, the Mauthner cells and their associated network are an attractive model, given their experimental accessibility and fast development, driving ethologically relevant behavior in the first five days of development. Here, we describe methods for immunostaining electrical and chemical synapse proteins at 3-7 days post fertilization (dpf) in zebrafish using tricholoracetic acid fixation. The methods presented are ideally suited to easily visualize neural circuits and synapses within the fish.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. 22 × 22 mm (7/8 × 7/8\") Micro Cover Glasses, Square, No.1 (VWR, catalog number: 48366-067)\n2. Superfrost Microscope Slides, 25 × 75 × 1 (Fisher, catalog number: 12-550-143)\n3. ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Fisher, catalog number: P10144)\n4. Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222 sometimes called MESAB, Tricaine-S, Syndel)\n5. TCA (trichloroacetic acid, Sigma, catalog number: T6399-500G)\n6. Triton X-100 (VWR, catalog number: 0694-1L)\n7. Western Block (Sigma, catalog number: 11921673001)\n8. Glycerol (VWR, catalog number: AAAA16205-0F)\n9. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\n\nRecipes for working solutions:\n1. Trichloroacetic Acid (TCA): Make 20% TCA and freeze in useful aliquots for future use. For a 2% working solution, dilute 1:10 in 1× PBS.\n2. Tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222 sometimes called MESAB): 4 g/L of Tricaine-S to make a stock solution, 170 mg/L to make a working solution, \\~50 mg/L for sedation.\n3. PBSTx: 1× PBS, 0.5% Triton-X.\n4. Western Block with Sodium Azide: Sodium Azide prevents microorganism growth. Add 1 mL of 20% Sodium Azide to a 100 mL bottle of Western Blocking Reagent for the 10× Western Block, and freeze down in 1 mL aliquots at -20°C. For the working solution, make up 1× with PBS-Tx. Primary and secondary antibodies are diluted in Western Block.\n5. Glycerol dilutions: 25%, 50%, and 75% in PBS.\nEquipments: 1. Dumont Medical Tweezers, Style 5, High Precision, 0.01 mm × 0.05 mm (EMS, catalog number: 72877-D)\n2. Benchtop tube rocker\nProcedures: A. DAY ONE – Fix and block\nNote: The days noted are for the standard procedure. Step lengths can be modified (see below) and will alter the days in which a particular step is performed.\n1. Anesthetize your fish (using tricaine methanesulfonate, fish will be anesthetized in less than a minute), then sort into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (less than 100 fish per tube).\n2. Make a 2% TCA solution fresh from frozen aliquots.\n3. Using a Pasteur pipette, remove any excess fish water from the microcentrifuge tubes.\n4. Add 1 mL of 2% TCA to your larvae and rock for 3-4 h at room temperature (RT). Ensure the liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube.\n5. Wash in 1 mL of PBS for 5 × 5 min.\n6. Block using 1 mL of Western Block overnight at 4°C on a benchtop tube rocker.\n\nB. DAY TWO – Primary antibody stain\n(Option A) – Dissect, then stain\nNote: An alternative dissection method is at the end of the protocol, see F.\n1. Place embryos in a Sylgard plate with 1× PBS.\n2. Prepare new microcentrifuge tubes with Western Block. Dissected larvae will be placed into these tubes.\n3. Use pins to hold larvae during dissection.\n4. Remove eye and skin with tungsten wire and forceps.\n5. Use wire to cut off cerebellum, optic tectum, and telencephon. This decreases the thickness of the brain by approximately half when mounting.\n6. Place the dissected brain into microcentrifuge with Western Block.\n7. Block for 3 h at RT.\n8. Remove Western Block.\n9. Sonicate and vortex primary antibodies (at least twice).\n10. Add primary antibody mix (primary antibodies in Western Block). Rock overnight at 4°C. Ensure liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube.\n\n(Option B) – Whole larvae stain\n1. Remove Western Block.\n2. Sonicate/mix primary antibodies (at least twice).\n3. Add primary antibody mix (500 μL to 1 mL of primary antibodies in Western Block). Rock overnight at 4°C. Ensure liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube (Alternatively, you can rock overnight at RT).\n\nNote: The above protocols give the best results. Alternatively, steps can be truncated. Rather than blocking overnight, the block can be added for one hour, and then the fish transferred to the primary antibody to rock overnight. Instead of incubating with primary antibody overnight at 4°C, this can be done at RT for 5 h up to overnight.\n\nC. DAY THREE – Wash and add the fluorescent secondary antibody\n1. Remove primary antibody. Save the antibodies as they can be re-used many times. Staining becomes better with several uses (three to five times), as the antibodies are pre-absorbed. Over many uses, the staining will degrade (ten times). Store at 4°C. We advise adding sodium azide, as it is key to preserving the antibody long-term.\n2. Wash with PBSTx at least 5 × 15 min, but preferably all afternoon, with five changes of 1 mL of PBSTx.\n3. Remove PBSTx. (Alternatively, you can block/rock for 1 h at RT, then proceed.)\n4. Sonicate/mix secondary antibodies (at least twice).\n5. Add secondary antibody mix (500 μL to 1 mL of secondary antibodies in Western Block).\n6. Rock overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Ensure liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube. Note: The secondary antibody can be added for 3 h up to overnight. Note that all steps that shorten antibody incubations tend to decrease image quality, while those that increase the length or temperature tend to decrease the life of the antibodies.\n\nD. DAY FOUR – Wash\n1. Remove secondary antibody. (Save as noted above for primary antibodies.)\n2. Wash with 1 mL of PBSTx at least 4 × 15 min.\n3. Final change into new PBSTx, wash overnight at 4°C in the dark. (Alternatively, you can skip this final wash and move to the mounting stage.)\n\nE. DAY FIVE – Mount for imaging\n1. (Option A) – Mount using bridge\n    a. Remove PBSTx and replace with 1 mL of fresh PBSTx.\n    b. Create ‘bridge’ slide for mounting. Add one coverslip glued on either side of a slide using crazy glue. This becomes a bridge for your sample, so that you do not crush it. (Figure 1 in original protocol showed mounting the brain on a bridge slide.)\n    c. Move brains into Prolong Gold antifade and mount the brain ventral side up. Place a coverslip on top of the bridge. Ensure there is enough Prolong Gold antifade to cover the sample and watch out for air bubbles.\n    d. Seal edges with nail polish.\n    e. Image.\n\n2. (Option B) – Mount using vacuum grease pillars on coverslip\n    a. Dehydrate through 1 mL of 25%, 50%, and 75% glycerol in PBS (do not use PBSTx, as it creates bubbles with glycerol). After the addition of the next higher concentration of glycerol solution, wait for the embryos to ‘fall’ to the bottom of the tube before moving to the next dilution.\n    b. Dissect animals if necessary. See alternative dissection protocol below (F).\n    c. Mount the brains, using the minimal amount of vacuum grease to form pillars on the coverslip so that the tissue is not distorted. (Figure 2 in original protocol showed mounting brains using grease pillars.)\n        i. Mount brains with the ventral side to the coverslip. You can mount multiple brains if you are careful.\n        ii. Remove excess glycerol if present (use Kimwipe).\n        iii. Use vacuum grease to make pillars on each corner of the coverslip.\n        iv. Carefully place a slide onto the prepared coverslip. Gently push down on the slide, until the vacuum grease compresses and the brains barely touch the slide. The brains should be very carefully sandwiched between coverslip and slide, just touching each one.\n        v. Turn slide/coverslip over.\n        vi. Touch a small drop of Prolong Gold antifade to the edge of coverslip – it will ‘wick’ into the coverslip to surround the brains. Before applying, gently squeeze the tube and check to ensure you are not adding bubbles. Allow 3-4 h or overnight to set.\n    d. Seal edges with nail polish.\n    e. Image.\n\nF. Additional zebrafish brain/spine dissection method after TCA fixation and immunostaining\n1. Insert forceps just above the notochord, near the posterior end of the fish laying on its side. Separate forceps, to split the fish into two halves.\n2. Using these separated dorsal and ventral (D/V) larval halves, grab the end of each half with forceps, and pull the fish in two – the break should follow just dorsal to the notochord. The best imaging occurs when the notochord goes with the ventral half.\n3. Pull gently, but persistently – sometimes forceps must be repositioned. The otolith is often challenging for the D/V separation – ideally, the otolith will separate with the ventral half. If not, dissect it off. Ideally, the brain will separate from the eyes anteriorly. If not, dissect them off.\n4. The ventral half can be discarded (jaws, yolk, etc.).\n5. The dorsal half contains the brain/spine, with a clear view from the ventral side into the brain. Mount this dorsal half with its ventral portion facing the cover glass imaging surface.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: In vivo OVA-specific Cytotoxic CD8+ T Cell Killing Assay\nBackground: Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells are responsible for the lysis of cells expressing peptides associated with MHC class I molecules and derived from infection with a pathogen or from mutated antigens. In order to quantify in vivo this antigen-specific CD8+ T cell killing activity, we use the in vivo killing assay (IVK). Here we describe the protocol for the lysis of cells expressing a CD8+ T cell epitope of the OVA protein (SIINFEKL). Mice are previously immunized with the OVA protein and 7 days after immunization, they receive a mix of target cells, prepared from naive C57BL/6 spleen cells pulsed with the SIINFEKL peptide and labeled with high level of CFSE and of non-pulsed control cells labeled with low level of CFSE. One day later, the spleen cells of recipient mice are isolated and analyzed by FACS to measure the amount of CFSEhigh cells and CFSElow cells. The percentage of lysis is calculated by the difference between CFSE high versus low in immunized vs non-immunized mice.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. 0.5 ml insulin syringe (Terumo Corporation, catalog number: SS05M2713M)\n2.

Flow cytometer: Cyan (Beckman Coulter) or Fortessa (Becton Dickinson)\nProcedures: A. Day 0. Immunize mice with:\n1. CpG-B 1826 (30 μg/mouse)\n2. DOTAP (60 μg/mouse)\n3. Ovalbumin (100 μg/mouse)\nAll reagents are diluted in sterile 1x DPBS (to a final total volume of 200 μl/mouse) and the final solution is inoculated by intravenous (i.v.) retro-orbital injection in the eye of each mouse. As control for immunization, some mice receive retro-orbital i.v. injections of sterile 1x DPBS: these naive/non-immunized mice are used to calculate the % of specific lysis, as compared to immunized mice. Naive non-injected mice will also be used for isolating splenocytes and pulsing them with peptides, and will also be used as control mice (see step B14).\n\nB. Day 7. Injection of splenocytes pulsed with the peptide and labeled with a high concentration of CFSE + splenocytes not pulsed with the peptide but labeled with a low concentration of CFSE\n1. Isolate the spleen of naive non-injected mice (1 naive non-injected mouse for every 3 OVA-immunized or DPBS-injected mice + control mouse) and place each spleen in a well (6-well plate).\n2. Mechanically disrupt the spleen to obtain single-cell suspensions in a small volume of DPBS (1-2 ml), and then wash cells with DPBS and centrifuge (652 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C).\n3. Resuspend the pellet and treat with ACK lysing buffer to lyse red blood cells: Add 2 ml of ACK per spleen and incubate for 2 min (at room temperature, RT).\n4. Wash each spleen suspension with 2-3 ml of RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin and filter them on cell strainers (40 μm). Pool the suspensions all together in one Falcon 50 tube (or more if many spleens are used for the experiments), add RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin until you reach 50 ml and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C).\n5. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin; divide splenocytes into two halves. Add the peptide to one half (peptide SIINFEKL 10 μg/ml in the final volume of 2 ml per half spleen). For example: If 10 spleens are used for the experiment, 10 half-spleens will be pulsed with SIINFEKL (meaning 10 x 2 ml = 20 ml final volume) while the other half (equal volume as the final volume of spleen+ SIINFEKL; in our example: 20 ml) will remain without peptide.\n6. Incubate both suspensions for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Gently mix every 10 min.\n7. Wash in RT DPBS 1x and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C) twice.\n8. In the meantime, prepare two solutions of CFSE (dilutions in 1x DPBS) in the dark:\na. CFSEhigh solution: 2.5 μM (diluted from the stock solution kept at -20 °C)\nb. CFSElow solution: 0.25 μM (dilution 1/10 from the CFSEhigh solution)\n9. Discard the supernatants and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of DPBS and count the cells.\n10. Then, add the necessary volume of the CFSE solutions to their respective cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of 107 cells/ml as follows:\na. CFSEhigh solution to the splenocytes pulsed with peptide (2.5 μM of CSFE)\nb. CFSElow solution to the splenocytes without peptide (0.25 μM of CSFE)\nIncubate 15 min at RT in the dark.\n11. Wash each suspension with 40 ml of RPMI + 10% of FCS and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).\n12. Discard the supernatant and wash again with RPMI + 10% of FCS and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).\n13. Discard the supernatant, resuspend the pellet in 1x DPBS and count cells:\na. Splenocytes pulsed with peptide (and CFSEhigh)\nb. Splenocytes without peptide (and CFSElow)\nResuspend each suspension in DPBS to obtain a final concentration of 5 x 106/100 μl.\n\n14. Pool suspensions (both CFSEhigh andlow) together (ratio 1:1) and inject i.v. 200 μl of the mix to OVA-immunized and DPBS-injected mice. Do not forget to inject a naive (previously non-injected, non-immunized) mouse as control.\n\n15. Wait 20-24 h.\n\nC. Day 8\n1. Kill recipient mice, remove their spleen and put it on a cell strainer (40 μm) on a Falcon 50 tube. Mechanically disrupt the spleens (individually) to obtain single-cell suspensions, treat splenocytes with ACK buffer (2 ml/spleen) as described in steps B1-3.\n2. Wash with DPBS 1x and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, RT).\n3. Resuspend pellets in 1 ml of FACS buffer.\n4. Count cells and resuspend them to get 5 x 107 cell/ml.\n5. Filter using a 40 μm cell strainer (to avoid FACS blocking).\n6. FACS acquisition: On the Forward Scatter (FSC) vs. Side scatter (SSC) plot, gate cells on total splenocytes, then when plotting CFSE (in the FL-1, GFP or FITC channel) vs. SSC, gate on total CFSE+ cells. Within this gate, using another CFSE vs. SSC plot, distinguish between the CFSEhigh and CFSElow populations. Acquire 10,000 total CFSE+ events (i.e. of both populations: CFSEhigh and low). The number of total CFSE+ events should be the same for all the samples analyzed in order to better compare between OVA-immunized and non-immunized mice. In case 10,000 events cannot be reached, 5,000 events can be acquired, as long as the final number is the same for all samples.\n\nD. Data analysis\n1. For the analysis of the FACS data after acquisition, 2 populations (the CFSEhigh and the CFSElow) are distinguished by using the following gating strategy: Define the splenocyte gate on FSC and SSC, then after excluding the doublets, gate on the total CFSE+ cells. Within the CFSE+ cells, gate on the CFSEhigh and the CFSElow and determine (i) the percentage of CFSEhigh within total CFSE+ cells and (ii) the percentage of CFSElow within total CFSE+ cells.\n2. To calculate the percentage of specific lysis, use the following equation for each mouse (OVA or DPBS) or sample, compared to one control “naive” un-injected mouse: % specific lysis = 100 - [100 x (% CFSEhigh immunized mouse/% CFSElow immunized mouse)/(% CFSEhigh naive mouse/% CFSElow naive mouse).\n\nFigure 1. Representative dot plot of the FACS analysis of an in vivo killing assay.\nThe dot plots in Figure 1 represent the CFSE staining (vs. side scatter, SSC) in a non-immunized control mouse (A), a non-immunized naive mouse (B) and an OVA-immunized mouse (C) after gating on total splenocytes and then on total CFSE+ cells, as detailed in steps C21 and D22. The CFSEhigh and CFSElow gates are indicated for each mouse, and the respective percentages are shown in pink above each gate. The CFSEhigh population represents target cells pulsed with the SIINFEKL peptide, while CFSElow populations represent target cells not pulsed with any peptide.\n\nC57BL/6 mice are immunized with the OVA protein (or with DPBS; non-immunized mice) and 7 days later, they receive a mix of spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice, pulsed with the SIINFEKL peptide and stained with a high concentration of CFSE and cells not pulsed with the peptide, stained with a low concentration of CFSE, at a 1:1 ration. One day later, the spleen cells from recipient mice are isolated and analyzed by FACS to determine the % of CFSEhigh and CFSElow cells in each mouse (OVA-immunized mouse in Figure 1C and non-immunized mice in Figure 1B).\n\nOne naive non-injected mouse is used as the “control naive mouse” (Figure 1A) in the formula detailed above (this mouse is mentioned in step B14). All OVA-immunized (ex: Figure 1C) but also the naive DPBS-injected mice (a.k.a. non-immunized mice, ex: Figure 1B) will be compared to this control mouse in order to quantify and compare the specific lysis of non-immunized mice and OVA-immunized mice.\nIn this example, using the formula detailed above, the % of specific lysis for the non-immunized mouse in B is calculated as follows:\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x (42.6/57.1)/(45/54.6)]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.746/0.824]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.905]\n% specific lysis = 100 - 90.5\n% specific lysis = 9.5\nThe % of specific lysis for the OVA-immunized mouse in C is calculated as follows: % specific lysis = 100 - [100 x (3.2/96.5)/(45/54.6)]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.033/0.824]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.040]\n% specific lysis = 100 - 4.0\n% specific lysis = 96\nAs shown in the example, the % of specific lysis of each mouse is calculated as compared to the naive non-injected mouse set at control mouse.\nNotes: This protocol was optimized for the vaccination with the Ova protein and for the IVK test with the corresponding H-2b restricted OVA peptide that activates the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The protocol can be adapted to other vaccine candidates and their corresponding peptide with a CD8+ T cell epitope. The respective concentrations should be optimized."

    "text": "Experiment Name: Kinetic Analysis of Monoclonal Antibody Binding to HIV-1 gp120-derived Hyperglycosylated Cores\nBackground: Kinetic analysis of antibodies is one of the important studies for characterization of antibodies and screening of ligands. In our recent study (Ingale et al., 2014), we compared the antigenic profiles and binding characteristics of four HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) core immunogens using multiple monoclonal antibodies by Bio-Layer Light Interferometry (BLI). This technology enables real-time analysis of interactions on the surface of a fiber optic biosensor by accurately measuring kinetic constants such as Ka, Kd, and KD in a 96-well format.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. 96-well black bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, catalog number: 655209)\n2. Anti-human Fc capture biosensors (Pall Corporation, ForteBio®, catalog number: 18-5060)\n3. Phosphate buffered saline (Life Technologies, GibcoTM, catalog number: 100-10023)\n4. Monoclonal antibodies and hyperglycosylated core analytes (expressed in-house)\nEquipments: 1. Octet Red system (Pall Corporation, ForteBio®, part number: 30-5048)\n\nSoftware:\n1. Data Analysis 6.2 evaluation software (Forte Bio)\nProcedures: Biosensors are tips coated with proprietary biocompatible matrix that can bind to Fc region of human immunoglobulin with minimal non-specific binding. In a separate black bottom plate, the biosensors were hydrated in 200 μl PBS for 10 min at room temperature prior to the experiment. The sample plate was generated according to a template. The buffer wells were filled with 200 μl PBS. Selected monoclonal antibodies were diluted to 5 μg/ml in PBS and dispensed at a volume of 200 μl into each well of the loading column as indicated in the template. The H1 well was filled with 200 μl PBS. The analyte (HIV envelope core glycoprotein is used in the example) was 2-fold serially diluted in PBS starting from 1 μM to 31.25 nM in a separate plate and transferred in a 200 μl volume in the \"association column\" of the template. The sensor plate (plate with bio-sensors) and sample plate (plate with other reagents) were then inserted into the Octet Red machine and a basic kinetic measurement experiment was performed as follows:\n\n1. The sensors were dipped in buffer for equilibration.\n2. The sensors were transferred to the sensor plate and monoclonal antibodies were captured on the sensors at 1,000 rpm for 60 sec.\n3. Sensors were washed in PBS and a stable baseline was achieved at 1,000 rpm for 60 sec.\n4. The antibody-immobilized sensors were immersed in analyte-containing wells for 600 sec at 1,000 rpm to allow potential association of analyte with a given monoclonal antibody.\n5. Bio-sensors were next transferred to and immersed in wells containing a volume of 200 μl PBS at 1,000 rpm for 600 sec for the dissociation of the bound analyte.\n\nDuring each run, two reference sensors were included: first, where at the association step the sensors were immersed in PBS buffer as an analyte control (to be used for subtraction during analysis of the raw data); and second, where no antibody was immobilized on the sensor and a 500 nM analyte was used during the association phase to assess the level of non-specific binding of analyte to the anti-human Fc capture sensors, if any such interactions were detected. The data was analyzed with Data Analysis 6.2 evaluation software. The data was processed using analyte control reference well for subtraction from the experimental data curves, aligning Y-axis to the baseline, and applying Savitzky-Golay as the filtering process. Next, the association and dissociation response curves were plotted using 1:1 model and global full curve fitting to compute the Ka, Kd, and KD values.\n\nFigure 1.

    "text": "Experiment Name: In vitro Quality Assessments of Perfluorocarbon Nanoemulsions for Near-infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Inflammation in Preclinical Models\nBackground: Tracking macrophages by non-invasive molecular imaging can provide useful insights into the immunobiology of inflammatory disorders in preclinical disease models. Perfluorocarbon nanoemulsions (PFC-NEs) have been well documented in their ability to be taken up by macrophages through phagocytosis and serve as 19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tracers of inflammation in vivo and ex vivo. Incorporation of near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dyes in PFC-NEs can help monitor the spatiotemporal distribution of macrophages in vivo during inflammatory processes, using NIRF imaging as a complementary methodology to MRI. Here, we discuss in depth how both colloidal and fluorescence stabilities of the PFC-NEs are essential for successful and reliable macrophage tracking in vivo and for their detection in excised tissues ex vivo by NIRF imaging. Furthermore, PFC-NE quality assures NIRF imaging reproducibility and reliability across preclinical studies, providing insights into inflammation progression and therapeutic response. Previous studies focused on assessments of colloidal property changes in response to stress and during storage as a means of quality control. We recently focused on the joint evaluation of both colloidal and fluorescence properties and their relationship to NIRF imaging outcomes. In this protocol, we summarize the key assessments of the fluorescent dye–labeled nanoemulsions, which include long-term particle size distribution monitoring as the measure of colloidal stability and monitoring of the fluorescence signal. Due to its simplicity and reproducibility, our protocols are easy to adopt for researchers to assess the quality of PFC-NEs for in vivo NIRF imaging applications.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

Nanoemulsion droplet size, polydispersity index (PDI), and fluorescence signal are measured throughout the lifetime of the nanoemulsion. At the same time, the other listed stress tests can be done within the first couple of weeks after manufacturing. All colloidal characterization and stress tests are elaborately described throughout this manuscript.

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement of size and zeta potential\nThis analytical technique is used to measure particle size (nm), polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential (mV). We have utilized this method in numerous publications to describe and characterize our nanoemulsions (NEs). Our method begins with a 60 s equilibrium step for the DLS measurements, followed by three rounds of typically 15 runs at 25 °C. A number of runs needed for the optimal size distribution measurement is automatically selected by the Zetasizer Software 7.13 based on particle counts during each run. Variations in size and PDI over time or after stress indicate destabilization of colloidal infrastructure. Size measurements using Malvern’s Zetasizer provide size distribution curves that can indicate particle size uniformity within a dilution. Samples are prepared as dilutions in a medium. New nanoemulsion formulations are diluted 1:20 v/v to 1:160 v/v to determine the dilution that achieves the highest intensity size distribution. The nanoemulsions are diluted at either 1:40 v/v or 1:80 v/v. Once selected, the same dilution ratio (v/v) should be used in all tests requiring size, PDI, or zeta potential measurement. Standard size, PDI, and zeta potential measurements are diluted in HPLC (Type 1 water). Dilution medium is subject to change, pending the type of test intended to be run. The presented methods detail the simultaneous measurement of size and zeta potential by creating a dilution at a 2 mL volume of nanoemulsion in water. However, a 1 mL dilution can be prepared if only size or PDI is measured. An example data is shown in Figure 2A.\n\nMethod:\n1. Dilute nanoemulsion in HPLC grade water 1:40 v/v or 1:80 v/v to create a total volume of 2 mL in a plastic cuvette compatible with Zetasizer Nano.\n2. Insert the cuvette into the Zetasizer and measure size and PDI.\n3. After each completed measurement, remove the cuvette and flush 1 mL of nanoemulsion dilution through a zeta potential measurement cuvette to wet the electrodes.\n4. Fill the zeta cuvette with the remaining dilution to the zeta cuvette fill line.\n5. Place the zeta cuvette into the Zetasizer Nano and measure the zeta potential.\n\nB. Filtration test\nFor nanoemulsions intended for in vivo use, it is important to have a method of sterilization that does not affect the colloidal stability of the nano-formulation. Within the confines of a sterile hood, nanoemulsions are filtered through a 0.22 or 0.45 μm syringe filter. Filter size depends on the size of the particles to be filtered. For example, it is difficult to filter particles of ~200 nm and above using a 0.22 μm filter because particles may not easily flow through the filter, and the stress of forcing particles through a small filter pore may affect colloidal structure and stability. In these cases, a larger filter size can be used, such as 0.45 μm. Most of our nanoemulsions with a particle size <140 nm and PDI <0.15 can be filtered using 0.22 μm filters. Nanoemulsions falling outside this size and PDI range must be filtered using 0.45 μm pore size filters. See Figure 2A for typical measurements of a filtration test. Example data are shown in Figure 2E.\n\nMethod:\n1. Measure size and PDI of unfiltered nanoemulsion in HPLC grade water.\n2. Filter a sample of the nanoemulsion within a sterile hood using a 0.22 or 0.45 μm filter.\n3. Using the same dilution ratio (v/v) as in step 1 (Method A), measure the size and PDI of the filtered nanoemulsion.\n4. Compare the size values before and after filtration to see if there is a significant change in the size value. Note: Size variation of ±10% is within the acceptable range (for details, see references: Janjic et al., 2018; Herneisey et al., 2019; Saleem et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020; Nichols et al., 2021; Herneisey and Janjic, 2023).\n\nC. Laboratory grade sterility testing before use in animal models\nPFC-NEs are manufactured non-sterile and are sterile-filtered through either a 0.22 or 0.45 μm syringe filter, depending on nanoemulsion droplet size. To validate nanoemulsions for use in animal studies, we utilize a sterility protocol adapted from the USP 34 microbiological tests, article 71 [(71) Sterility Tests, 2016]. It utilizes changes in pH before and after incubation in culture media to determine sterility. Statistically significant pH deviations are determined by a t-test calculated using GraphPad Software. A significant pH change indicates that the nanoemulsion is not sterile. Selected media offer desirable growth conditions for biological contaminants such as bacteria and fungi. Fluid thioglycolate medium is used to detect only anaerobic bacteria, and trypticase soy broth is used to detect aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi.\n\nMethod:\n1. Dissolve nanoemulsions into the following media at 1:40 v/v ratios (0.5 mL of nanoemulsion to 19.5 mL of medium).\n    a. Fluid thioglycolate medium: in a water bath, 30–35 °C.\n    b. Trypticase soy broth: incubated at 22.5 ±2.5 °C.\n2. Divide the dilutions into two portions, one for initial pH measurement and the other portion for incubation over time.\n3. Take a photograph of the appearance of the sample in the media before incubation begins. This will act as the medium control.\n4. Measure pH for both medium control and sample dilutions.\n5. Seal all the sample tubes and incubate the nanoemulsions in the media solutions for 14–28 days.\n6. Visually assess media for microorganism growth (turbidity), photograph again and compare to photograph from step 3, and then measure pH again.\n\nD. Centrifugation test\nTo assess colloidal stability of nanoemulsions in physically adverse conditions, such as emulating rough shipping conditions and aggressive handling, centrifugation is used. Nanoemulsion colloidal resilience to centrifugation is also important because we utilize centrifugation to measure a formulation’s drug content and separate nanoemulsion treatments from cells during in vitro cell culture assays (Herneisey et al., 2019). In our experience, centrifugation at 3,000 rpm (840× g) for 30 min has not led to significant size changes. An example of centrifugation test results is shown in Figure 2D, showing differences in droplet size before and after centrifugation.\n\nMethod:\n1. Isolate 500 μL of undiluted and filtered nanoemulsion into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n2. Centrifuge both tubes at 1,100 rpm (113× g) for 5 min at ambient temperature (25 °C).\n3. Pipette out 100 μL of the samples and measure their size and PDI in HPLC grade water.\n4. Centrifuge the remaining 400 μL of sample in the tubes at 3,000 rpm (840× g) for 5 min at 25 °C.\n5. Remove enough of the sample from each tube to prepare a dilution in HPLC grade water for size and PDI measurement (Nichols et al., 2021).\n6. Compare the sizes of all the samples (non-centrifuged, filtered samples serve as controls). Note: The centrifugation step should not lead to significant size change for stable nanoemulsions, with any change being typically less than 10%.\n\nE. Serum stability\nColloidal and fluorescence stability needs to be carefully evaluated to avoid formulation failure in vivo. While it is easy to convincingly show how the formulation performs under in vitro conditions, it is extremely challenging to predict in vivo behavior of nanoemulsions once they come into contact with complex biological media. Such media contains various components such as lipids, proteins, electrolytes, etc., all of which can determine the fate of the nanoemulsion, impacting biodistribution, toxicity, and the pharmacokinetic profile. The serum stability test is crucial if the nanoemulsions are intended for biomedical testing in animals (Moore et al., 2015). An example of serum stability test results is shown in Figure 2C, showing differences in droplet size before and after incubation for 72 h in serum-containing media at body temperature.\n\nMethod:\n1. Prepare triplicate 1.0 mL dilutions of nanoemulsion in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with the following:\n    a. HPLC grade water\n    b. DMEM\n    c. 20% FBS in DMEM\n2. Measure size of the first set of dilution using DLS. This is the control, 0-hour time point reading.\n3. Incubate the remaining two dilutions at 37 °C.\n4. Measure size of the second dilution after 24 h and the size of the third dilution after 72 h. There is no need to further dilute the samples prior to DLS measurement because the nanoemulsion is diluted enough during initial preparation in step 1.\n5. Compare any size differences between the measurements.\n\nNote: An alternate version of the serum stability test can be carried out in HPLC grade water, 1× PBS, DMEM medium, 10% FBS in DMEM, and 20% FBS in DMEM and size measurements followed up after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h.\n\nF. Thermal cycling\nThermal cycling studies are performed to study the temperature sensitivity/tolerance of nanoemulsions and to accelerate the aging of the formulation. This test can also help determine the appropriate storage conditions and predict shelf life for the prepared nanoemulsions (Herneisey et al., 2019).\n\nMethod:\n1. Aliquot 5.0 mL of undiluted, filtered nanoemulsion to a 15 mL vial.\n2. Seal the vials using parafilm and store them at 4 °C.\n3. After a 24 h incubation at 4 °C, transfer the vials to an incubator set at 50 °C and incubate for another 24 h.\n4. Cycle the vials between 4 °C and 50 °C for four thermal cycles per temperature. Each thermal cycle is 24 h, total thermal cycling time is eight days.\n5. After the cycles are completed, allow the samples to equilibrate to room temperature for 1 h and then measure the size and PDI.\n6. Measurements of freshly prepared filtered nanoemulsions continuously stored at ambient temperature are used as control.\n\nG. Fluorescence stability\nTo determine the long-term fluorescence stability of NIRF-labeled nanoemulsions, it is important to quantify the fluorescence at regular intervals to check for the loss of fluorescence. Our lab protocols were established using Li-COR Odyssey Classic Imager (Nichols et al., 2021) but can be easily adapted for other fluorescent plate readers (Herneisey and Janjic, 2023). Imager focus and intensity settings are adjusted to obtain the highest fluorescence signal without oversaturating and bleaching samples. Multiple measurements are obtained to determine the optimal setting selection. The Odyssey M Imaging system can also obtain fluorescence measurements using focus offset. Focus offset is determined the same way as on the Odyssey Classic. Once initial optimal settings are determined, the same settings are used for all follow-up measurements. We assess initial fluorescence in vitro to assure that the nanoemulsion signal is high enough to be detected in vivo during animal studies. Example of in vitro fluorescence stability monitoring is shown in Figure 2F, where serial dilutions of nanoemulsions are imaged and fluorescence quantified with Image Studio Ver 5.2. Figure 3 shows example data for monitoring inflammation in vivo by measuring fluorescence in mice on the Li-COR Pearl imager up to 40 days following tail vein injection of NIRF-labeled PFC-NEs. Fluorescence differences correspond to changes in macrophage infiltration patterns in response to the drug celecoxib (CXB) delivered in a drug-loaded NIRF-labeled PFC-NE (CXB-NE) (Liu et al., 2020).\n\nMethod:\n1. HPLC grade water was used to prepare six serial dilutions of nanoemulsions starting from 1:5 v/v (200 μL of nanoemulsion with 800 μL of water) through 1:160 v/v, in a 24-well plate.\n2. Three replicates of 100 μL from each dilution were transferred to a clear, flat-bottomed 96-well plate and the plate was read on the Li-COR Odyssey Imager.\n3. The imaging parameters such as focus offset (e.g., 0.5–1.0) and intensity (e.g., 0.5) are adjusted to each plate/nanoemulsion combination used for the freshly prepared nanoemulsions and are kept constant for all follow up measurements.\n4. DiR [1,1′-Dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-Tetramethylindotricarbocyanine Iodide, DiIC18(7)] is our most preferred near-infrared dye, which can be detected using an 800 nm fluorescent channel.\n5. Combinations of dyes, such as DiR (800 nm) and DiD (700 nm) [DiIC18(5); 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′- tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt], can be incorporated and measured in a single formulation if the dyes have different detection wavelengths (nm).\n6. Repeat the fluorescence measurements on D0 (Day 0), D7, D15, D30, D60, D90, and so on as per the study requirements to check for fluorescence stability. The fluorescence loss should not be greater than 10% of the initial value (Herneisey and Janjic, 2023). Note: Our lab has shown stable nanoemulsion fluorescence for a maximum period of 215 days, in vitro (Herneisey and Janjic, 2023) and that PFC-NEs can be detected in excised tissues after a period of 40 days following their in vivo administration (Liu et al., 2020).\n\nFigure 3.

    "text": "Experiment Name: Staining of Membrane Receptors with Fluorescently-labeled DNA Aptamers for Super-resolution Imaging\nBackground: One of the most prominent applications of fluorescent super-resolution microscopy is the study of nanodomain arrangements of receptors and the endocytic pathway. Staining methods are becoming crucial for answering questions on the nanoscale, therefore, the use of small and monovalent affinity probes is of great interest in super-resolution microscopy with biological samples. One kind of affinity probe is the aptamer. Aptamers are single DNA or RNA sequences that bind with high affinity to their targets and due to their small size they are able to (i) place the fluorophore in close proximity to the protein of interest and (ii) bind to most of the protein of interest overcoming the steric hindrance effect, resulting in better staining density. Here we describe a detailed protocol with which to stain live cells using aptamers and to image them with Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy. In this protocol, the stainings were performed with commercially available aptamers that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ErbB2) and the ephrin type-A receptor 2 (Epha2). Since aptamers can be coupled to most of the popular fluorophores, we believe that the procedure presented here can be extended to the large majority of the current super-resolution microscopy techniques.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

ImageJ\n2. MATLAB (MathWorks, Massachusetts, USA)\nProcedures: A. Coupling of dye to aptamers\nDuring this step a thiol-maleimide cross-linking reaction is performed to conjugate the fluorophore to aptamers. Alternatively, aptamers with a 3’-amino group can be used for further conjugation with NHS esters (e.g., Atto647N NHS-ester). Some fluorescently labeled aptamers are also commercially available.\n1. Add 10 nmoles of the thiolated aptamer with 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine solution (TCEP; see Recipe 1) in 100 µl of 0.1 M TEAA. Heat the tube at 70 °C for 3 min and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 1 h.\n2. Desalt this reaction by size exclusion chromatography on a Biospin 6 column according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n3. Add to the reduced aptamer (from step A2) 4 µl of 10 µg/µl maleimide-functionalized Atto647N (previously dissolved in DMSO) and mix the contents well by pipetting or vortexing.\n4. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n5. Recover the fluorophore-labelled aptamer by ethanol precipitation: add 100 µl of 300 mM NaCl and 450 µl cold ethanol, mix carefully by inverting the closed sample several times and freeze the sample in dry ice for 20 min (or at -20 °C for several hours), centrifuge at 15,000 x g (rcf) at 4 °C for 30 min, discard the supernatant and wash the pellet in 50 µl of 70% ethanol.\n6. Resuspend in 50 µl 1x DPBS and desalt on a Biospin 6 column into 1x DPBS.\n7. Measure the absorbance ratio at 260 nm and 650 nm.\n8. Confirm the labeling efficiency and absence of free dye by reversed phase HLPC (e.g., on a Nucleosil 100-5 C18 4 x 250 mm column using a gradient of 0-40% acetonitrile in TEAA buffer in 30 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 30 °C) or by anion exchange HPLC (e.g., Dionex DNAPac PA200 4 x 250 mm column using a gradient of 0-75% buffer B (see Recipe 12) in buffer A (see Recipe 11) in 40 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 60 °C.\n9. Store the labeled aptamer sample at -20 °C until use.\n\nB. Cell culture preparation prior to staining\nCell lines containing the receptor of interest (and cell lines lacking it, used as negative controls) should be seeded into 12-well plates containing coated coverslips with poly-L-lysine (PLL) one day before the aptamer staining. Depending on the cell line, choose adequate cell numbers (use the hemocytometer to count the cells) to reach approximately 70-80% confluence after 12-16 h incubation. The entire procedure described below must be performed under sterile conditions under a cell culture hood.\n1. HeLa (Epha2a positive) cells are grown in plates with complete DMEM medium (see Recipe 2) and A-431 (EGFR positive) and SKBR3 (ErbB2R positive) cells are cultured in complete RPMI medium (see Recipe 3). All cell lines are maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n2. To split cells, first wash cells with sterile 1x DPBS, add 2-3 ml of trypsin-EDTA to cover the surface of the plate and incubate the plate for 1-5 min at 37 °C or until cells are completely detached. Add 10 ml of complete DMEM medium or RPMI medium to inactivate trypsin. Gently pipette up and down the medium containing the inactivated trypsin to detach all cells from the plate and transfer them into a sterile 15 ml tube.\n3. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 rpm (\\~250 x g) for 4 min at RT.\n4. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of complete DMEM medium/RPMI medium. Dilute the resuspended cells to the desired concentration in fresh complete DMEM or RPMI medium and add 1 ml to every well of the 12-well plates containing PLL treated coverslips (for PLL stock solution preparation and dilution, see Recipe 4). Incubate the plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until staining.\n\nC. Preparation of functional aptamer: folding reaction\nDuring this step, aptamers are exposed to a high temperature at an appropriate magnesium concentration which allows them to attain a proper folding prior to the staining procedure. For better results, the folding reaction should be freshly performed each time before staining. Before starting the folding reaction, prepare a stock solution diluting aptamers in 1x DPBS to a final concentration of 30 µM and store it protected from light at 4 °C.\n1. Prepare 10 µl of 10 µM functional aptamer by mixing 3.3 µl of fluorescently labelled aptamer (30 µM aptamer stock solution), 2 µl of 5x PBS (see Recipe 5), 2 µl of 5x MgCl2 (see Recipe 6) and 2.7 µl of ultrapure DNase- and RNase-free distilled water. Please note that this reaction should be carried out in PCR tubes that fit the thermal cycler.\n2. Heat up the aptamer solution to 75 °C for 3 min and then cool down to 20 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min using a thermal cycler.\n\nD. Aptamer live cells staining\n1. Aspirate the medium from the cells prepared during Procedure B, rinse briefly once with complete DMEM or RPMI depending on the cell line and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (in the cell culture incubator) with 500 µl/well of freshly prepared blocking solution containing sheared salmon sperm DNA and dextran sulfate (see Recipe 7).\n2. In the meantime, prepare the metal plate used for staining/incubation at 37 °C. Fix with tape a piece of Parafilm® M (large enough to fit all coverslips to be stained) on the surface. This step is demonstrated in Video 1, which shows the metal plate preparation for aptamer live staining. Note that this video is for demonstration only and this step should be performed inside a cell culture hood. Pre-heat the metal plate containing the Parafilm® M in the cell culture incubator.\n3. After blocking (step D1), carefully remove the coverslips from the 12-well plate using half-curved-forceps, remove the excess blocking solution by gently tapping the edges of the coverslips with a soft paper tissue and place the coverslips upside down on 60 µl of staining solution (complete DMEM supplemented with 100 µg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and 250 nM folded aptamer) spotted onto the Parafilm® M fixed to the metal plate (made in step D2). This process is shown in Video 2, which demonstrates the removal of coverslips containing cells from the 12-well plates using half-curved-forceps and incubation of cells (on coverslips) with staining solution. Note that this video is for demonstration only and this step should be performed inside the cell culture hood. To avoid contamination, gloves should be sprayed with 70% ethanol. Incubate the cells for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n4. After incubation, carefully take the coverslips off the metal plate using half-curved-forceps, remove the excess staining solution by gently tapping the edges of the coverslips with a soft paper tissue, and then submerge it several times in large volumes (e.g., 20-40 ml in a small beaker) of ice-cold 1x DPBS. Briefly remove the excess 1x DPBS from the coverslips by tapping them on a tissue paper and place each one (cell-side-up) into a well of a new 12-well plate filled with 1 ml/well ice-cold 4% PFA (see Recipe 8) for fixation. The washing step after the staining procedure is shown in Video 3. Note that this video is for demonstration only and 4% PFA should only be handled in the fume hood.\n5. Fix the cells for 20 min on ice and subsequently at room temperature for another 25 min. During fixation, keep the plate protected from light to avoid fluorophore bleaching.\n6. Aspirate the PFA solution and add 1 ml of quenching solution (see Recipe 9) to each well. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature protected from light.\n7. Wash twice for 5 min with 1x DPBS (1 ml/well) and mount the coverslips with Mowiol® (see Recipe 10; e.g., 8-9 µl for an 18 mm coverslip) on microscopy glass slides.\n8. Dry the mounted coverslips in an oven at 37 °C for 20-30 min or overnight at RT and store at 4 °C protected from light until imaging.\nNotes: 1. To determine the saturating concentration or optimal staining concentration (best signal-to-noise ratio) for the aptamer of interest fixing the incubation time of staining (e.g., 60 min) and testing different aptamers concentrations ranging from 10-500 nM (or more) in positive cell lines is recommended. After staining with different concentrations of the aptamers, fixation and mounting, cells can be imaged in any epifluorescence microscope and fluorescent intensities can be calculated using as an example ImageJ or MATLAB.\n\n2. After defining the saturating conditions for the staining procedure, the next step is to test the binding specificity. This is achieved by evaluating the staining in the cells expressing the receptor and the cells that do not express it. Importantly, the staining conditions, the aptamer concentrations and the incubation times must be the same for both positive and negative cells. Once stained and fixed, cells can be imaged with an epifluorescence or confocal microscope. Negative cell lines should show virtually no specific fluorescent signal. For a proper control of the unspecific staining background, it is useful to test the immunolabeling with a random aptamer conjugated to the same fluorophore as the aptamer binding the specific target, in parallel. This control should not have any fluorescence signal. An additional control is the evaluation of the binding specificity by fluorescence flow cytometry analysis using the same controls.\n\n3. Every receptor has its own internalization kinetics. In this work and protocol we intend to maximize the labeling by internalization and therefore choose longer incubation times.\n\n4. If the aptamers contain BzdU (5-(N-benzylcarboxyamide)-2’-deoxyuridine) or any other hydrophobic groups, we recommend the addition of dextran sulfate to the blocking solution. An optimization of the dextran sulfate concentration in the pre-blocking solution strongly reduces the background caused by nonspecific binding due to electrostatic interaction of aptamers to the PLL-treated coverslip.\n\n5. If unspecific binding of the aptamer persists, increase the concentration of sheared salmon sperm DNA and/or dextran sulphate in the staining solution. The polyanionic competitor/blocking agent dextran sulfate also substantially reduces the nonspecific binding caused by electrostatic attraction of polyanionic aptamers to positively charged sites in nuclei, such as histones.\n\n6. For identification and quantification of endosome-like structures, colocalization studies are strongly recommended (Gomes de Castro et al., 2017)."

    "text": "Experiment Name: An Assay to Test the Capacity of Arabidopsis Plant Defensin Type1 Protein to Induce Cellular Zinc (Zn) Tolerance in Yeast\nBackground: Heterologous expression of genes in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is especially suitable to functionally study the corresponding encoded protein at the cellular level (Bonneaud et al., 1991). This is mainly because many strains defective in specific activities are available and could be complemented by homologous genes existing across the eukaryotic kingdom (http://www.yeastgenome.org/). However, the protocol we describe here is not a complementation but a “gain-of-function” assay. It is based on a drop-test assay that we have set up to assess the cellular zinc tolerance conferred by the expression of heterologous genes in the wild-type S. cerevisiae. Different dilutions of a yeast culture expressing the heterologous gene of interest are grown on a range of zinc-enriched plates, and are then compared to the control yeast expressing the empty vector. Working with different concentrations of both yeast and zinc are essential to succeed in describing zinc tolerance phenotype upon yeast transformation (Mirouze et al., 2006). This test has also proven to be valuable to differentiate among related members of gene families as exemplified for Arabidopsis Plant Defensin type1 (Shahzad et al., 2013).\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

Upon cooling of solid media, add necessary sterile amino acid solutions complementing auxotrophy (here leucine and methionine) and sterile zinc in order to reach concentrations that will be tested.\n    Note: Care should be taken to add necessary sterile amino acid solutions and sterile zinc when solid media has cooled down to \\~ 40 to 45 °C. This will prevent both the degradation of added amino acids and the precipitation of the metal.\nEquipments: 1. Sterile 250 ml borosilicate glass Erlen flask\n2. 1,000 ml bottle\n3. Typical 20 µl pipet\n4. Autoclave\n5. Heating oven (Universal Memmert, model: 400)\n6. New Brunswick™ Agitator (Eppendorf, model: Innova 44)\n7.

Integral water purification system (Merck Millipore Corporation, model: Milli-Q+)\n11. Scanner (Epson, model: 124OU)\nProcedures: On day -1:\nNote: For each yeast clone to be analyzed.\n1. Use a sterile inoculating loop to inoculate each yeast clone to be tested in 20 ml liquid selective YNB media in sterile 250 ml glass Erlen flask.\n2. Culture yeast cells at 30 °C under 200 rpm agitation Over Night (O/N).\nNote: At least three independent yeast clones are tested for each construct (harboring either recombinant or control plasmids).\n\nOn day 0:\nPrepare Petri dish for drop assay.\n3. Prepare sterile selective YNB solid media containing the appropriate amino acids and appropriate zinc sulfate concentration to be tested.\n4. Under laminar flux hood, pour 50 ml of sterile selective YNB solid media in each square 12 cm x 12 cm Petri dish.\nNote: Tolerance to zinc excess is usually tested around the final concentrations of 23, 25, 27.5, 30 and 32.5 mM. The control condition is without zinc added (≈1.4 µM). The leucine and methionine auxotrophy are complemented by the addition of the corresponding amino acids to the final concentrations of 0.75 mM and 0.33 mM, respectively.\n5. Let media solidify, cover opened, for 15 min. Close and store square Petri dish under the hood.\n\nPrepare yeast for drop assay.\nNote: All subsequent manipulations with yeast are performed under sterile conditions in laminar flow hood.\n6. Transfer O/N yeast culture in sterile 50 ml Falcon tubes.\n7. Centrifuge for 5 min at 5,000 x g at room temperature.\n8. Discard supernatant.\n9.

Use a pipet and sterile filter tips to drop 10 µl of each yeast dilution onto selective YNB media supplemented with ZnSO4 at various final concentrations (see Figure 1).\n    a. For steps 10 to 12: Yeast cells sediment particularly rapidly; hence make sure to fully agitate the yeast culture before taking a sample and / or before measuring optic density of a suspension and/or before drop assay.\n    b. For drop assays, separate the center of each drop by ≈1 cm.\n14. Allow drops to dry under the laminar flux hood.\n15. Close Petri dish and wrap them plastic foil (type Saran Wrap).\n16. Incubate in 30 °C incubator upside down.\n17. Monitor yeast growth every day and record results by scanning the Petri dish under black screen at a 600 dots per inch (dpi) resolution (usually less than one minute per scan).\nNotes: The BY4741 S. cerevisiae strain has several auxotrophic markers, in particular for the production of the amino acid histidine (his3∆1). Free histidine is a potent metal chelator and could, in particular, chelate zinc if this metal is present in the culture medium. The histidine (his3∆1) auxotrophy must thus be complemented by the expression of the corresponding HIS gene (here expressed from the pFL38 plasmid) and not by the addition of free histidine, which would bias the zinc tolerance test."

    "text": "Experiment Name: A Miniaturized Percoll Gradient Method for Isolation of Quiescent Cells of Yeast\nBackground: Quiescence, the temporary and reversible exit from proliferative growth, is a fundamental biological process. Budding yeast is a preeminent model for studying cellular quiescence owing to its rich experimental toolboxes and evolutionary conservation across eukaryotic pathways and processes that control quiescence. Yeast quiescent cells are reported to be isolated by the continuous linear Percoll gradient method and identified by combining different features such as cell cycle, heat resistance, and cell morphology (single cell). Generally, 10–25 mL of Percoll isotonic solution is first obtained by mixing Percoll with NaCl in 12.5–30 mL centrifugal tubes. Then, the gradient is prepared at high speed for 15–60 min. Finally, approximately 2 × 10^9 cells are collected, overlaid onto the preformed gradient, and centrifuged to obtain distinct cell fractions. This method requires more reagents and samples and special centrifuges and centrifuge tubes. Besides the cost, it is less favorable for experiments that require high-throughput analyses with a small volume of sample each time. The protocol described here aims to solve those problems by combining the use of 2 mL centrifugal tubes with density marker beads. The protocol also focuses on how to optimize the buoyant density distribution of the density gradient solution such that the density bands better match those of different fraction cells. This will help fully separate quiescent and non-quiescent cells. The protocol can be easily adapted to a wide variety of unicellular microbes with different buoyancy density differentiation during cultivation, such as yeast and bacteria.\nMaterials & Reagents: Biological materials:\n1.

Interested users should reach out to the sales departments of the corresponding companies for acquisition.\nProcedures: A. Strain activation, inoculation, regular sampling, and detection\n1. Streak W303-1A strain from glycerol stock with a disposable loop on YPDA solid medium and grow at 30 °C for 2–3 days.\n2. Inoculate a single colony into 3 mL of the YPDA liquid medium in a glass test tube. Grow with agitation at 200 rpm for 16 h at 30 °C.\n3. Inoculate the cells into 60 mL of the YPDA liquid medium in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask at an initial OD600 of 0.2 and grow with agitation at 200 rpm for 16 h at 30 °C. Take 2 mL of the post-inoculation culture for subsequent cell cycle detection (section B). If cell cycle detection cannot be performed timely, the cultures should be stored at -20 °C. Normally, storing at -20 °C will not affect cell cycle detection and it will allow the cell to be taken out and fixed when convenient.\n4. Measure the OD600 of the cells in culture and residual glucose content at regular intervals, for example, every 6 h. Note: OD600 is measured using a spectrophotometer in a cuvette; glucose content is measured by a Biosensors analyzer. If necessary, the sample prepared can be diluted with water. Generally, 1 OD600 corresponds to approximately 1 × 10^7 cells.\n5. Examine the cells under a standard light microscope with 10× eyepiece and 40× objective lens at regular intervals and confirm that there is no bacterial contamination in the culture. If bacteria are detected, remove the cultures and repeat steps A1–A4. Observe the proportion of single cells simultaneously.\n\nB. Cell cycle detection by flow cytometer to determine the time to separate Q cells\n1. When glucose is depleted and the proportion of single cells increases significantly upon microscopy, take each sample of approximately 3 × 10^6 cells (0.3 OD600) in centrifugal tubes for cell cycle detection at regular intervals (every 6 or 12 h).\n2.

Adjust voltage to center the G1/G0 intensity peak at 75.\n6. When the G0/G1 peak in the flow cytometry histogram is similar to or slightly higher than the G2 peak, it indicates the active production of Q cells and the optimal time to begin isolating Q cells.\n\nC. Optimization of Percoll gradient solution preparation to obtain suitable buoyant density distribution in a 2 mL centrifuge tube using density marker beads\n1. Optimize the Percoll isotonic solution percentage:\n   a. Add the Percoll isotonic solution and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final volume of 1.67 mL in a 2 mL centrifuge tube with different percentages [Percoll isotonic solution percentage: 100%, 90%, 80%, ..., e.g., when the Percoll isotonic solution percentage is 90%, add 1.34 mL of Percoll isotonic solution and 0.33 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)]. Vortex for 10 s to mix.\n   b. Add 30 μL of density marker beads and vortex for 10 s to mix.\n   c. Spin 2 mL centrifuge tubes equipped with different Percoll isotonic solution percentages in an angle rotor table centrifuge at 20,000× g for 15 min at RT.\n2. Optimize centrifugation time: Prepare four tubes using the Percoll isotonic solution percentage with the most uniform density marker bead band distribution according to step C1a. Centrifuge each at 20,000× g for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, respectively.\n3. Select the Percoll isotonic solution percentage and centrifugation time resulting in the most uniform density marker beads for subsequent experiments.\n\nD. Preparation of density gradient solution and cell suspensions and centrifugation and isolation of Q and NQ cells\n1. Prepare the density gradient solution according to the optimal protocol obtained in section C (excluding step C1b).\n2. Cells preparation:\n   a. Measure the OD600 by spectrophotometry in a cuvette of the culture and take a sample greater than approximately 2 × 10^8 cells (20 OD600) in centrifugal tubes. Pellet cells according to step B2a.\n   b. Resuspend cells in 200 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and then vortex to mix. Pellet cells according to step B2a. Repeat until removing the culture medium.\n   c. Resuspend approximately 2 × 10^8 pelleted cells (20 OD600) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final volume of 30 μL. Store the remaining cells at 4 °C for future analysis.\n   Note: If the volume of the cell resuspension for separation is not 30 μL, adjust the volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to maintain the percentage of the Percoll isotonic solution when preparing the density gradient.\n3. Centrifuge to separate the cell resuspension:\n   a. Carefully pipette the cell resuspension onto the density gradient solution by placing the pipette at the side of the 2 mL centrifuge tube.\n   b. Centrifuge the samples from step D3a and the centrifuge tube containing density marker beads with the same Percoll isotonic solution percentage from section C in a swing-bucket centrifuge at 400× g for 1 h at 16 °C.\n4. Collection of Q cells and NQ cells:\n   a. Carefully remove cells from different density layers in 2 mL centrifuge tubes, collecting the upper NQ and the lower Q fraction cells, which correspond to the coverage area of density marker beads with a density below 1.09 g/L and the area covered by the density marker bead with a density of 1.13 g/L, respectively.\n   b. Dilute the collected Q and NQ cells with sterile deionized H2O and then vortex to mix.\n   c. Pellet cells according to step B2a. Repeat until removing the density gradient solution by decanting or pipetting. Critical: Avoid salt-containing buffers during washing to avoid Percoll rebinding with ions, which could recreate a density gradient and prevent cell sedimentation at the tube bottom.\n   d. Resuspend the collected cells with 1–2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and store at 4 °C.\n   Pause point: Properly sealed, collected cell resuspension can be left at 4 ˚C for 2 weeks.\n\nE.

Heat resistance:\n1. Take approximately 3 × 10^6 cells (0.3 OD600) from each of the pre-separation and post-separation samples. Pellet cells according to step B2a.\n2. Resuspend pelleted cells in normal saline to a final volume of 300 μL.\n3. Plating colony-forming units (CFU):\n   a. Take 200 μL of cell resuspension in step E2 and dilute in 2 mL of normal saline. Plate 200 μL of this dilution onto several YPDA solid mediums.\n   b. Heat treatment: incubate plates at 55 °C for 1 h and then transfer to culture at 30 °C for 2 days. Non-heat treatment: Culture at 30 °C for 2 days. Have at least three sets of data for each group.\n   c. Count the number of colonies.\n   Note: This dilution is designed to plate approximately 200–400 cells when cultured at 30 °C and may need to be adjusted based on variations between spectrophotometers and strains.\n4. Spotting cells:\n   a. Serially dilute the cell resuspension 10-fold five times using normal saline and then spot 2 μL of each of the six concentrations on YPDA plates.\n   b.

Resuspend pelleted cells in normal saline to a final volume of 100 μL.\n3. Take 10 μL of cell resuspension and use DIC with a 10× eyepiece and 63× NA 1.40 oil objective lens on the LCSM.\nNote: To observe cell morphology, you can use various methods. A standard light microscope allows real-time assessment but has poor image capture. Phase-contrast microscopy offers better observation and image capture, while LCSM enables simultaneous DIC and fluorescence imaging.\nNotes: None"

Inverted fluorescence microscopy (Leica Microsystems, model: Leica TCS SP5)\n\nSoftware:\n1. ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) for image analysis\nProcedures: 1. Preparation of a dissection dish:\n   Mix two kinds of silicone solutions (3.6 ml KE-106 and 0.4 ml CAT-RG) in a 35-mm culture dish (or its lid) and incubate at 37 °C for 2 days to congeal silicone. This dissection dish may be used several times. Figure 2 illustrates the dissection dish.\n\n2. Preparation of an observation tank:\n   a. Put 2 pieces of plastic tape (20 x 25 mm) on a cutting board and cut out a square (10 x 10 mm) in the center of these tapes.\n   b. Place the newly cut piece of tape on a cover slip (24 x 40 mm).\n   c. Turn over the remaining piece of tape from step 2a.\n   d. Put the tips of two insect pins on the adhesive surface of the tape and align the two pins so that they are 2 mm apart (as shown in Figure 3).\n   e. Put the tape with insect pins from step 2d on the tape attached to the cover glass as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 illustrates the assembly of an observation tank.\n\n3. Dissection of a larva:\n   Prepare a fillet of larva on the dissection dish according to the following steps (a slightly modified larval dissection protocol from Brent et al., 2009). Use HL-3 warmed to room temperature:\n   a. Pick up a third-instar larva and wash the body surface in HL-3 solution (see Recipes). Third-instar larvae (three days after hatching at 25 °C) stop feeding behavior and climb on wall of a vial, which is referred to as wandering behavior.\n   b. Transfer the larva into 1 ml of HL-3 solution on the dissection dish.\n   c. Hold both the front and tail edges of the larva using short insect pins (red arrowheads in Figure 4A), keeping its dorsal side upward so that the tracheae (white arrows in Figure 4A) can be seen through the body wall.\n   d. Cut the body wall along the dorsal midline from the tail side (yellow dashed line in Figure 4B) to construct a fillet, holding the four corners of the body wall with short pins (red arrowheads in Figures 4C and 4D).\n   e. Carefully remove the gut, fat bodies and salivary glands without injuring the ventral ganglion (orange arrows in Figures 4E and 4F), axons or body muscles. Fluorescence will be observed within the ventral ganglion (yellow dashed circles in Figures 4G and 4H) and axons (white arrowheads in Figures 4G and 4H) when using flies that express fluorescence markers in motor neurons. The green fluorescence signals in Figures 4F and 4H are derived from preproANF-EMD. Figure 4 illustrates the dissection procedure for a larval fillet on a dissection dish. Scale bars = 1 mm for (A-F) and 5 µm for (G, H).\n\n4. Placement of a larva in observation tank:\n   a. Carefully remove the short pins from the larva and transfer the larva to the observation tank filled with HL-3.\n   b. Extend the head and tail of the larva carefully and secure them with pins (epidermis side up, as shown in Figure 5). Rinse by changing the HL-3 solution twice and put a cover glass (18 x 18 mm) to protect the larva against desiccation. Note: There is no need to hold the cover glass with nail polish. An organic solvent in nail polish could affect the neuronal activity.\n   Figure 5 illustrates the setting for an inverted microscope. A. Top view of an observation tank where a larval fillet is retained. B. Enlarged top view of a larval fillet retained with two pins in an observation tank. C. Larval motor neuron axons are observed from below using a 40x objective.\n\n5. Imaging:\n   a. Locate a motor neuron axon (as shown in Figure 6A) under an inverted fluorescence microscope. A laser-scanning microscope equipped with a high sensitivity detector is preferable.\n   b. Capture live images every 0.1 sec for 30 sec under a 40x objective lens (as shown in Videos 1 and 2). To ensure that healthy neurons are imaged, it is important to complete the dissection within 5 min and subsequent observation within 5 min. Note: We usually use motor neuron axons projecting to the A6 muscles (as shown in Figure 4I). See also Figure 1A in Matzat et al., 2015. Choosing specific axons and observation of the same axonal region may be important to evaluate transport property.\n   Video 1 shows a representative movie of axonal flow of the dense core vesicles in TBPH+/- flies. The genotype used is UAS-preproANF-EMD/+; TBPHΔ23/+; D42-Gal4/+.\n   Video 2 shows a representative movie of axonal flow of the dense core vesicles in TBPH+/- flies expressing p150Glued. The genotype used is UAS-preproANF-EMD/+; TBPHΔ23/UAS-p150Glued-HA; D42-Gal4/+.\n\n6. Data Analysis:\n   6.1. Constructing a kymograph:\n      Construct a kymograph using ImageJ software by using the ‘Image > Stacks > Reslice’ menu (as shown in Figure 6). The Reslice menu makes kymographs from each line ROI (X-axis ROI), which is set automatically on the stacked images. The resultant kymographs consist of stacked data for each line ROI. ‘Output spacing’ and ‘Avoid interpolation’ are parameters to define the size of Y-axis ROI. Because one line ROI cannot track vesicles snaking through the axon, appropriate setting of ‘Output spacing’ is required. ‘Z-Projection’ image from all stacked kymographs represents vesicle movements in the defined ROI during all observation time.\n      Detailed steps for kymograph generation (as shown in Figure 6):\n      1) Open stacked images. To crop images, see an explanation in the box.\n      2) Select ‘Image > Stacks > Reslice’ menu.\n      3) Input an appropriate value in ‘Output spacing’ and check ‘Avoid interpolation’. ‘Output spacing’ defines the size of Y-axis ROI and we used 0.152.\n      4) Resultant resliced images represent kymographs of non-interpolated X-axis ROI (each pixel-line from top to bottom).\n      5) ‘Image > Stacks > Z-Projection’ menu merges all of stacked kymographs. Select ‘Max Intensity’ tab in the Z-Projection window.\n      6) Then, a merged kymograph appears.\n      Note: To select a whole axon area, use Area selection tools as shown in the box of Figure 6. Figure 6 illustrates the generation of a kymograph from stacked images.\n\n   6.2. Removing stationary vesicles:\n      Use the ‘Image Calculator > Operation: Subtract’ menu to remove stationary vesicles from the kymograph (as shown in Figure 7).\n      Detailed steps for image processing to extract moving vesicles (as shown in Figure 7):\n      1) Open stacked images and its first image. Select ‘Process > Image Calculator’ menu.\n      2) Refer to the stacked images as Image1 and its first image as Image2. Select ‘Subtract’ tab in the ‘Image calculator’ window.\n      3) Signals in the stacked images are automatically subtracted from those in its first image.\n      4) The resultant images represent moving signals.\n\n   6.3. Interpretation of results:\n      The kymographs obtained through the procedures described in Figure 6 and Figure 7 can indicate, for example, that the overexpression of a dynein motor component p150Glued in TBPH+/- larvae inhibits axonal transport of dense core vesicles in both directions (as shown in Figure 8). Detailed data processing analysis and replicates including applied statistical tests could be found in the original manuscript, see Hosaka et al., 2017.\n      Figure 8 illustrates typical imaging results of axonal transport. A. The dense core vesicles (green) in motor neuron axons of the indicated genotypes. B. Kymographs show motility of the dense core vesicles. The X-axis represents the position of the dense core vesicle, and the Y-axis is time (moving from top to bottom). Vertical lines correspond to stationary dense core vesicles, and diagonal lines are moving dense core vesicles. Anterograde movements have positive slopes, whereas retrograde movements have negative slopes. These kymographs were obtained by the methods described in Figure 6. C. Resultant images after subtraction extract moving dense core vesicles as described in Figure 7.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: Botrytis cinerea in vivo Inoculation Assays for Early-, Middle- and Latestage Strawberries\nBackground: Strawberries are delicious and nutritious fruits that are widely cultivated and consumed around the world, either fresh or in various products such as jam, juice, and ice cream. Botrytis cinerea is a fungal pathogen that causes gray mold disease on many crops, including strawberries. Disease monitoring is an important aspect for growing commercial crops like strawberry because there is an urgent need to develop effective strategies to control this destructive gray mold disease. In this protocol, we provide an important tool to monitor the gray mold fungal infection progression in different developmental stages of strawberry. There are different types of inoculation assays for B. cinerea on strawberry plants, such as in vitro (in/on a culture medium) or in vivo (in a living plant). In vivo inoculation assays can be performed at early, middle, and late stages of strawberry development. Here, we describe three methods for in vivo inoculation assays of B. cinerea on strawberry plants. For early-stage strawberry plants, we modified the traditional fungal disc inoculation method to apply to fungal infection on strawberry leaves. For middle-stage strawberry plants, we developed the flower infection assay by dropping fungal conidia onto flowers. For late-stage strawberry plants, we tracked the survival rate of strawberry fruits after fungal conidia infection. This protocol has been successfully used in both lab and greenhouse conditions. It can be applied to other flowering plants or non-model species with appropriate modifications.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet Software (Microsoft 365)\n2. GraphPad Prism (v9.0.2)\nAll raw example datasets are included in this protocol.\nProcedures: A. Preparation of plant materials\n1. Purchase fresh commercial strawberry seedlings (e.g., day-neutral variety Monterey-UC) from Lassen Canyon Nursery INC (Lassen Canyon | Strawberry Plants | Lassen Canyon Nursery). We conducted a greenhouse trial to test the susceptibility of the Monterey-UC seedlings to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, which causes gray mold disease. We inoculated the seedlings with the fungus and observed infection symptoms.\n2. Select the uniform seedlings and transplant them in a commercial potting mix in the greenhouse (temperature: 20–32 ℃; humidity: 40%–60%) with a 16:8 h light/darkness cycle. We selected uniform seedlings based on the following criteria: similar root length, root biomass, and crown (stem) diameter.\n\nB. Fungal inoculum preparation and inoculation\n1. Fungal inoculum preparation\n    a. Withdraw B. cinerea SS2Ap1 strain from -80 °C glycerol stock (25%) and grow for four days on half-strength PDA at room temperature (RT).\n    b. Keep the fungal agar plate for another \\~10 days at RT for conidiation.\n\n2. Strawberry leaf inoculation (Early-stage)\n    a. Punch new fungal discs from the edge of the PDA agar plates using the reverse side of sterile 1 mL tips.\n    b. Inoculate the fully expanded strawberry leaves with fungal discs.\n    c. Secure them with sterile tape.\n    d. Punch a hole on each leaf through the attached fungal disc with a sterile needle.\n    e. Spray sterile water mist on the leaf surface.\n    f. Place the inoculated leaves in plastic bags to maintain high humidity.\n    g. For early-stage (\\~2-month-old) strawberry leaf inoculation, the lesion diameter was recorded at 4 days post inoculation (dpi).\n    h. Analyze the data. “Mock” stands for the inoculation with no fungal conidia on strawberry leaves. “Infected” stands for the inoculation with fungal conidia on strawberry leaves (two-tailed unpaired t-test).\n    *Procedure for inoculating strawberry leaves with Botrytis cinerea at early stage: After the seedling transplant, fresh four-day-old fungal discs were taken from the agar plate edge and inoculated to early-stage (\\~2-month-old) strawberry leaves. The fungal discs' mycelia side was firmly attached to the upside of strawberry leaves with micropore tapes. A sterilized needle was used to wound the leaf and facilitate fungal penetration. Sterile water was sprayed on infected leaves and enclosed in a sandwich bag to maintain relative high humidity. A dark-brown necrosis lesion was detected on the inoculated leaves at 4 dpi, and the lesion diameter was measured for data analysis.\n\n3. Strawberry flower inoculation (Middle-stage)\n    a. Wash fungal conidia from the agar plates with sterile water.\n    b. Filter washed conidia with sterile lens paper to a 2 mL tube and centrifuge to enrich the conidia.\n    c. Dilute the conidia with half-strength V8 medium to appropriate concentration by counting conidia under a light microscope (10x objective) using a hemocytometer. We used the following formula to calculate the conidial concentration using the hemocytometer: conidia concentration = N × 10^4 conidia/mL, where N is the number of conidia counted under the 10x objective (when 10 μL of conidial solution was applied to the hemocytometer).\n    d. Adjust the conidial suspension to the final inoculum concentration as needed. For example, we used 100 conidia/mL suspension (20 μL drop) to inoculate middle-stage (\\~3-month-old) strawberry flowers.\n    e. Spray sterile water to the inside of a plastic bag (e.g., sandwich bag) and use it to cover the inoculated flower carefully.\n    f. Record the disease symptom of inoculated flowers with a 0–4 scoring system.\n    g. Analyze the data. “Mock” stands for the inoculation with no fungal conidia on strawberry flowers. “Infected” stands for the inoculation with fungal conidia on strawberry flowers (two-tailed unpaired t-test).\n    *Procedure for inoculating strawberry flowers with Botrytis cinerea at middle stage: Fungal conidia were washed from potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates, enriched by centrifuge, and calculated using a hemocytometer. A 20 μL droplet of conidia suspension was inoculated in the middle-stage (\\~3-month-old) newly opened strawberry flower and enclosed into a sandwich bag pre-sprayed with sterile water to maintain high relative humidity. Four days later, disease symptoms of inoculated flowers were scored on a 0–4 scale and further analyzed.\n\n4. Strawberry fruit inoculation (Late-stage)\n    a. Prepare the conidia inoculum as above in steps B.3.a–B.3.e, with the exception that newly emerging fruits (\\~3.5-month-old) are inoculated instead of flowers.\n    b. Record the disease development at 4, 8, and 12 dpi. We counted the number of healthy and diseased fruits at 12 dpi.\n    c. Analyze the data. We calculated the survival rate using this formula: survival rate (%) = the number of healthy fruits/the number of total fruits × 100. “LD” stands for inoculation with low dosage of fungal conidia (100 conidia/mL). “HD” stands for inoculation with fungal high dosage of fungal conidia (5,000 conidia/mL) (two-tailed unpaired t-test).\n    *Procedure of evaluating fruit survival rate to Botrytis cinerea infection at the late-flowering to early-fruiting stage: Inoculated newly emerging fruits (\\~3.5-month-old) were monitored until 12 dpi to evaluate fruit development and its survival rate to overcome the gray mold disease.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: A Simple Method for the Isolation and in vitro Expansion of Highly Pure Mouse and Human Satellite Cells\nBackground: Satellite cells (SCs) are muscle stem cells capable of regenerating injured muscle. The study of their functional potential depends on the availability of methods for the isolation and expansion of pure SCs, which retain myogenic properties after serial passages in vitro. Here, we describe a protocol for the isolation and in vitro expansion of highly pure mouse and human SCs based on ice-cold treatment (ICT). The ICT is carried out by briefly incubating the dish containing a heterogeneous mix of adherent muscle mononuclear cells on ice for 15-30 min, which leads to the detachment only of the SCs, and gives rise to SC cultures with 95-100% purity. This approach can also be used to passage the cells, allowing SC expansion over extended periods of time without compromising their proliferation or differentiation potential. Overall, the ICT method is cost-effective, accessible, technically simple, reproducible, and highly efficient.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

Aspirate the supernatant with a 10 ml serological pipette and resuspend the minced muscles in 10 ml of collagenase type II digestion solution per gram of tissue (see Recipes). Note: It is important to use a pipette to remove the supernatant, as the pellet is not stable in this step.\n      b. Seal the tubes with parafilm and transfer them to a shaking (100 rpm) pre-warmed (37°C) water bath for 45 min. Note: Position the tubes horizontally so that they are completely submerged in water.\n      c. Spray the tubes with 70% ethanol and transfer them to a biosafety cabinet.\n      d. Block the digestion enzyme by adding 10 ml of enzyme neutralization buffer per gram of tissue (see Recipes).\n      e. Pipette up and down with a 10 ml serological pipette five times.\n      f. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\n    4. Day 1: Muscle digestion II (referencing Figure 1d).\n      a.

Seal the tubes with parafilm and transfer them into a shaking (100 rpm) pre-warmed (37°C) water bath (as in Step I.A.3.b) for 30 min.\n      c. Spray the tubes with 70% ethanol and transfer them to a biosafety cabinet.\n      d. Block the digestion by adding 10 ml of enzyme neutralization buffer per gram of tissue (see Recipes).\n      e. Pipette up and down with a 10 ml serological pipette five times.\n      f. Sieve the digested muscles through a 70 µm cell strainer into a new 50 ml tube.\n      g. Sieve the digested muscles through a 40 µm cell strainer into a new 50 ml tube. Note: An adequately digested muscle will pass through the strainers easily. If necessary, the muscle digest can be passed again through another strainer to get rid of most of the cell debris and undigested muscle.\n      h. Centrifuge the tube with muscle digest at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\n      i. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 ml of DMEM 10% FBS. Count the number of muscle mononuclear cells using trypan blue. Note: At this step, you can combine the pellets if more than 1 mouse was used. On average, the number of cells released after digestion from 3, 4-8-weeks-old mice is around 10^7 cells.\n    5. Day 1: Pre-plating step (referencing Figure 1e-1f).\n      a. Plate the cells at 10^5/ml in a 100 mm dish (uncoated) in 20 ml of DMEM 10% FBS 1% pen/strep and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\n      b. Collect the non-adhered cells in a 50 ml tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\n      c. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in DMEM 10% FBS 1% pen/strep.\n      d. Count the resuspended cells and plate them at 10^5/ml into a 100 mm dish (uncoated) in 20 ml of DMEM 10% FBS 1% pen/strep. Incubate the cells at 37°C for 1 h (as in Step I.A.5.a).\n      e. Collect and transfer the non-adhered cells into a 50 ml tube. Note: On average, the pre-plating steps remove around 50% of strongly adherent cells such as fibroblasts.\n      f. Centrifuge the tube with non-adhered cells at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\n      g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in growth medium (see Recipes).\n      h. Plate the cells into 0.1% gelatin coated 100 mm dishes at 10^6 cells/dish. Grow them overnight (referencing Figure 1g).\n    6. Day 2: Ice-cold treatment (ICT) (referencing Figure 1h).\n      a. Wash the dishes containing the heterogeneous mix of adhered muscle cells three times with 10 ml of PBS (with MgCl2 and CaCl2) at RT. Note: Gently pipette PBS all around the dish.\n      b. Add 10 ml of ice-cold PBS (without MgCl2 and CaCl2) to each 100 mm dish. Note: Both PBS with or without CaCl2 can be used. However, using PBS without CaCl2 will facilitate detachment.\n      c. Fill a polystyrene box with ice (0°C) and place the dishes on top of the ice for 15-30 min with occasional gentle manual shaking of the dish (creating a swirling motion). Notes: i. If purity is of utmost importance (e.g., 99-100% purity), the dishes should not be kept on ice for longer than 30 min. Nevertheless, the dishes can be kept on ice for up to 1 h to increase cell yield, with purity still high at 90%. ii. The original dishes (from day 1 of the isolation procedure) containing heterogeneous muscle cells can be kept up to day 3 of culture and used for further rounds of ICTs.\n      d. Collect the detached cells into a 50 ml tube.\n      e. Wash the original dish once more with 10 ml of PBS to collect the remaining detached cells. Note: Gently pipette PBS all around the dish.\n      f. Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\n      g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in growth medium.\n      h. Count the cells. Note: On average, 1.5 × 10^4 - 2 × 10^4 SCs can be collected after 30 min on ice at 24 h of culture of the original dish. A further 4 × 10^4 SCs can be collected after the second or third ICT at 48 h or 72 h of culture).\n      i. Plate the cells into 35 mm dishes precoated with 0.1% gelatin, at a density of 10^3 cells/dish and place them into a cell incubator. Note: At this density, the SC proliferate for up to three days. Afterward, they begin to differentiate. Increasing the plating density will accelerate the time it takes for the myoblasts to differentiate and fuse into myotubes.\n    7. Cell culture\n      a. Culture the cells in growth medium, changing the medium every two days.\n      b. To induce myoblast differentiation, remove growth medium and replace it with differentiation medium (see Recipes) once the cells reach 80% confluency.\n    8. Cell passaging\n      a. Place the dishes containing proliferating SCs on ice for up to 30 min.\n      b. Follow the steps described in I.A.6.\n  B. Isolation of human muscle satellite cells\n    Notes:\n      a. Experimental procedures using human muscle biopsies should be performed only after obtaining ethical approval and informed consent.\n      b. The number of SCs obtained from human muscle biopsies may vary depending on the age of the donor, with a smaller number of cells typically obtained from older donors.\n    1. Preparation prior to muscle dissection: Proceed as in Step I.A.1.\n    2. Muscle cutting\n      a. Place the human muscle biopsy in a 60 mm dish containing DMEM supplemented with 1% pen/strep. Work in a biosafety cabinet.\n      b. Remove any fat and connective tissue using scissors.\n      c. Finely cut up the muscle into 1 mm pieces using a sterile scalpel.\n      d. Transfer the minced muscles to a 50 ml tube and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\n    3. Muscle digestion I: Proceed as described in I.A.3.\n    4. Muscle digestion II: Proceed as described in I.A.4. Note: On average, 2 × 10^6 muscle mononuclear cells can be obtained from digestion of 1 g of human muscle biopsy.\n    5. Pre-plating: Proceed as in I.A.5.\n    6. ICT: Proceed as in I.A.6. To further enrich in SCs the heterogeneous muscle cell culture on day 1 after isolation, it may be necessary to grow it for an additional 3-4 days before proceeding to ICT (when the culture reaches a confluency of about 80%). Notes: a. On average, 1 × 10^4 SCs can be collected after the first ICT. b. A further 2 × 10^4 SCs can be collected after the second or third ICT at 48 h or 72 h of culture.\n    7. Cell culture: Proceed as in Step I.A.7. Note: Human SCs proliferate slower than mouse SCs, with a doubling time of 46 h.\nII. Analysis of mouse and human satellite cell specific marker expression by immunofluorescence staining\n  1. Grow the cells in a 35 mm dish.\n  2. Aspirate the medium and wash the dishes once with 1 ml of PBS with MgCl2 and CaCl2.\n  3. Fix the cells by adding 4% PFA (1 ml/35 mm dish) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Note: PFA is toxic and must be used under a chemical fume hood.\n  4. Discard the PFA into a toxic waste container and wash three times with 1 ml of PBS for 5 min each.\n  5. Permeabilize the cells by adding cold methanol (1 ml/35 mm dish) and incubate at -20°C for 6 min.\n  6. Discard the methanol into a toxic waste container and wash three times with 1 ml of PBS for 5 min each.\n  7. Remove the PBS and mark the border of the dish with a hydrophobic pen.\n  8. Block by adding PBS containing 5% goat serum (100 μl/35 mm dish) for 30 min at RT.\n  9. Remove the blocking solution and incubate the cells with the primary antibodies (100 μl/35 mm dish) at the appropriate dilution [Pax7 (1:10), MyoD (1:50), Myogenin (1:20), and Myosin Heavy Chain (1:20) diluted in sterile filtered 4% BSA/PBS] overnight in a humidified chamber at 4°C.\n  10. Remove the primary antibody solution and wash three times with 1 ml of PBS for 5 min each.\n  11.

    "text": "Experiment Name: Novel Protein-oligonucleotide Conjugation Method Involving a High-affinity Capture HaloTag Junshi Yazaki\nBackground: Highly sensitive quantitative protein profiling can play a key role in the early diagnosis of diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer. We developed a modified protein-oligonucleotide conjugation method termed HaloTag-mediated barcoding, for quantifying protein molecules at a higher sensitivity than conventional protein quantification methods. This novel and efficient conjugation method can be used to prepare HaloTag-barcoded proteins using a click chemistry-based labeling technique. Here, we describe the preparation of protein-DNA complexes and detection of protein-protein interactions which can be used in a HaloTag protein barcode assay to detect an antibody. The protocol includes procedures for preparing the ligand-oligonucleotide complex, plasmid DNA preparation for protein expression, and preparation of the protein-oligonucleotide complex. The described click reaction-based protocols simplify the conventional amine-ester reaction methods which require additional steps for chromatography purification.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

Figure 1 shows the flowchart of HaloTag-barcoding assay procedures. Designations on the left indicate the amount of time expected to complete each step. Prepare HaloTag expression clones (Steps 1- 13) and Ligand-DNA complex (Steps 21-22) in advance before use. Because reagents include only DNA and chemical compounds, they require no special storage condition (-20 °C). Prepare the HaloTag fused proteins immediately prior to use. We have not tested the shelf-life of HaloTag fused proteins (Steps 14-20) and purified barcode proteins (Steps 26-40). We recommend that the barcoded proteins be used within a few months.\n\nA. Preparation of DNA clones with HaloTag fusion\n1. ORFs cloned into pENTR are available from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, here) for $13 USD per pENTR clone (Yazaki et al., 2018). The pENTR clones are then recombined with the custom-designed HaloTag expression vector pIX-His-Halo:ccdB that was derived from pIX-Halo:ccdB (Yazaki et al., 2016; available here). Note that pENTR clones, in the link listed above, are named pENTR-sfi and pENTR-topo and contain spectinomycin and kanamycin resistance genes, respectively. Recombination of the clones with the HaloTag fusion vectors is performed to construct the barcoded proteins in this procedure; however, the procedure can be applied to HaloTag-ORF fusion clones from other organisms such as humans and mice.\n2. Reagents for a single reaction (modified from a standard Gateway cloning reaction): 1 μl 5x Buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1 μl pIX vector DNA (100 ng/μl), 1.5 μl TE buffer, 0.5 μl LR clonase enzyme (Invitrogen). Sub total volume: 4 μl per single LR recombination reaction.\n3. Pipet 4 μl from Step 2 into low profile tubes (0.2 ml).\n\nB. Transformation\n(Steps 4-13, including transformation and protein expression/preparation, are not provided in the input data.)\n\n(Steps 14-20, for HaloTag fused proteins preparation, are not provided in the input data.)\n\nD. Preparation of ligand-DNA complex and barcoded HaloTag-fused proteins\n21. Prepare 500 μM barcode DNA oligonucleotide with 5′ modification by dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) in RNase-free water (Table 1 and Recipe 14). Prepare 500 μM azido-HaloTag ligand, AzHLT-1 (Recipe 4).\n\nTable 1: Cycloalkyne-modified 100-bp DNA oligonucleotides. These oligonucleotides are synthesized as single-stranded DNA with 5′-dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) and 3′-tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) modifications. Each oligonucleotide consists of PCR primer 1 (31mer), a counting barcode (30mer, NNNN... variable region), a protein barcode (8mer), and PCR primer 2 (31mer).\n*   Oligo01: Protein barcode - ATTACTCG-E\n*   Oligo02: Protein barcode - TCCGGAGA-\n*   Oligo03: Protein barcode - CGCTCATT-\n*   Oligo04: Protein barcode - GAGATTCC-\n*   Oligo05: Protein barcode - ATTCAGAA-I\n*   Oligo06: Protein barcode - GAATTCGT-\n*   Oligo07: Protein barcode - CTGAAGCT-E\n*   Oligo08: Protein barcode - TAATGCGC-I\n*   Oligo09: Protein barcode - CGGCTATG-\n*   Oligo10: Protein barcode - TCCGCGAA-\n\n22. Mix 2 μl of 500 μM DNA (Table 1) and 0.5 μl of 500 μM azido-HaloTag ligand AzHLT-1 (4:1) and incubate at RT for 1 h (click reaction). The final concentrations of the mixture ingredients are 400 μM DNA and 100 μM HaloTag ligand.\n23. Combine 100 μl of HaloTag fused proteins obtained in Step 20 with 1 μl of DNA-ligand mixture from Step 22 at RT. Separately, combine 1 μg of HaloTag protein G with 1 μl of DNA-ligand mix for conjugation control.\n24. Incubate at RT for 1 h.\n25. Confirm DNA-protein conjugation by SDS-PAGE using 5-12.5% gradient gels (Figure 2). The size of the conjugated products should be higher than that of non-barcoded proteins. DNA conjugated proteins (10 μl; ~10% of total amount of reaction 101 μl) were loaded. Non-barcoded proteins (2.5 μl: 2.5% of input) were loaded as a negative control (lanes B1-B5, B6-B10) to indicate the original protein size. The results of HaloTag protein staining using TMR-modified DNA barcode are shown in Figure 2 (lanes A1-A5, A6-A10). The size of the protein-DNA conjugation shows a higher molecular weight in Figure 2 (lanes A1-A5, A6-A10) compared to HaloTag proteins with no conjugated DNA barcode according to TMR ligand staining in Figure 2 (lanes B1-B5, B6-B10). Stained proteins were visualized based on the fluorescence of TMR at 532 nm using a Fluorescent Image Analyzer (FujiFilm, FLA3000).\n\nFigure 2. Protein-DNA Conjugation results processing crude proteins expressed in vitro. Lanes A1-A10, HaloTag-protein conjugated with DNA was detected using dibenzocyclooctyneTMR staining and DNA oligonucleotide barcode conjugated with TMR. Lanes B1-B10, HaloTagprotein was detected using TMR ligand staining. Lane L, molecular ladder. All proteins were mixed with a DNA barcode and the azido-ligand AzHLT-1 at a 1:1:2 ratio (mol/mol/mol; lanes A1-A10) and incubated at RT for 1 h. Proteins: 1, At1g32640 (68 kDa); 2, At2g36270 (47 kDa); 3, At3g08500 (38 kDa); 4, At4g17870 (22 kDa); 5, At1g71930 (37 kDa); 6, At3g62420 (17 kDa); 7, At5g28770 (34 kDa); 8, At5g62380 (40 kDa); 9, At1g12260 (46 kDa); 10, At2G40330 (24 kDa). Protein sizes are specified without the HaloTag (33 kDa). Protein identification numbers correspond to previously assigned Arabidopsis thaliana gene identification numbers (Yazaki et al., 2016) (https://www.arabidopsis.org/). Right panel (proteins 6-10) was modified from Supplemental Figure S3 of Yazaki et al., 2020.\n\n26. Purify DNA-HaloTag fusion proteins (barcoded proteins) from Step 24 using a histidine tag purification kit (Pure Speed PS/E4 Multi Starter Kit and 1000/20 μl IMAC tips) at RT (Figure 3). Set the ColorTrack Guide under the platform with the deep-well plate aligned above (Figure 3A). Place the deep-well plate on the platform and slide it into position along the rails of the platform of the Pure Speed PS/E4 Multi Starter Kit (Figure 3B).\n27. For 10 barcoded protein purifications, use the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette to add 500 μl buffer A2 (Recipe 7) to wells A2-A11 in a 96-deepwell plate for column equilibration (Equilibration rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add 1,100 μl buffer A2 to wells B2-B11 to capture the sample (Capture rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add 500 μl buffer A2 to wells C2-C11 to wash the sample (1st wash rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add 500 μl buffer A2 to wells D2-D11 to wash the sample (2nd wash rows in Figure 3A, 3B). Add ~100 μl buffer B2 to wells E2-E11 to elute the purified sample (Elution rows in Figure 3A, 3B). After preparing the plate, add all barcoded protein sample (101 μl or rest of all samples) from Step 24 to wells B2-B11 immediately before starting purification (Capture rows in Figure 3A, 3B).\n28. Load the PureSpeed resin tips (PS Tips 1000/20 μl IMAC) to channel numbers 2-11 on the E12- 1200XLS multichannel pipette (Figure 3C).\n29. Load the two adapter tips (blue adapter for PS Tips 1000/20 μl IMAC) to channels number 1 and 12, which is next to the outer resin tip on the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette to secure the pipette assembly (Figure 3C).\n30. Place the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette with 12 loaded tips in wells A1-12 (equilibration rows) of the 96-deep-well plate for column equilibration (Figure 3D).\n31. Choose the default program for IMAC 1000/20 μl on the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette. The program for histidine tag purification contains resin equilibration (Figure 3D), capture (Figure 3E), wash (Figures 3F, 3G), and elution of the sequence (Figure 3H).\n32. Press the CONT key on the E12-1200XLS multichannel pipette to start the purification process and follow the instructions given on the screen of the multichannel pipette. This step allows for the elimination of excess amounts of barcode DNA, ligand, and barcode-ligand complex which are not conjugated to the proteins.\n\nFigure 3. Purification of the DNA-HaloTag fusion proteins. A. Set the ColorTrack Guide under the platform with the deepwell plate aligned above. B. Place the deepwell plate on the platform and slide it into position along the rails of the platform. C. Load the PureSpeed resin tips to channel numbers 2-11 on the pipette. Load the two adapter tips (blue adapter) to channels number 1 and 12. D. Place the pipette with 12 loaded tips in wells A1-12 (equilibration rows) of the 96-deepwell plate for column equilibration. Choose the default program for IMAC 1000/20 μl on the multichannel pipette. The program for histidine tag purification contains the sequence. E. Capture in wells B1-12. F. First wash in wells C1-12. G. Second wash in wells D1-12. H. Elution of the sample in wells E1-12.\n\n33. Procedure for dialysis. Insert the Amicon Ultra-2 10k column device into the filtrate collection tube.\n34. Pipet all purified barcoded proteins into the Amicon-ultra 10k column and add 1x PBS up to 2 ml in the column. Cover the column with the collection tube.\n35. Place the filtrate collection tube, covered with the 10k column, into the centrifuge rotor. Orient the membrane panel in the column to the center of the rotor (one panel facing up and the other panel facing down). Confirm that the device composed of the filtrate collection, filter column, and collection tube are seated on the bottom of the rotor. Ensure that the rim of the collection tube is completely inside the rotor walls. Ensure that the rotor is balanced with a second column device placed directly opposite of the first column.\n36. Centrifuge at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 20-30 min.\n37. Remove the filtrate collection tube. Invert the filter column and collection tube.\n38. Place the collection tube with filter column in the centrifuge. Ensure that the rotor is balanced by a second column device placed directly opposite of the first column.\n39. Centrifuge at 1,000 × g at 4 °C for 2 min to transfer the concentrated and dialyzed proteins from the filter column to the collection tube. The final concentrate volume is to be 30-60 μl. The protein levels produced by TNT and conjugation ratios are constant for most ORFs (Yazaki et al., 2016 and 2020 and Figure 2). Therefore, it is not necessary to check all purified conjugations using SDS-PAGE.\n40. Freeze and store the sample at -80 °C (not necessary to Snap-freeze).\n\nE.

Vortex the sample from Step 46. Prepare 12,000 molecules per 2 μl of sample with beads based on the qPCR results in Step 47 using the dilution buffer (Recipe 11). i.e., to obtain 12,000 molecules, follow the dilution condition below;\na. Prepare 1 pM of barcoded proteins based on the results of Step 47.\nb. Next, dilute 1 pM sample from Procedure A by 100-fold to prepare 0.01 pM of the proteins.\nc.

Discard the 80% ethanol by pipetting and add 250 μl of 80% ethanol.\n62. Discard the 80% ethanol by pipetting and let the tube dry.\n63. Remove the MagnaStand and pipet 23 μl of Qiagen elution buffer (buffer EB) into each tube. Incubate 1 min at RT.\n64. Set the tube on the MagnaStand and incubate 2 min at RT.\n65. Pipet 20 μl of the sample from Step 64 and transfer into new tubes.\n66. Check the sample quality using the Bioanalyzer high sensitivity chip mode (Figure 4A). The size of the amplified products should be 174 base pairs. Note: PCR primers with the forward and reverse index can be used for PCR amplification with Mighty Amp. Non-specific amplification may occur based on the combination of primers and amounts of template DNA used (Figure 4B black arrows). To avoid nonspecific amplification, we recommend changing the primer combination and template DNA, as non-specific amplification products may be obtained rather than the 174-bp product. Non-specific amplification in Figure 4B was observed with a primer combination of Foward6-Reverse3 in Table 2. To avoid this, pairs of primer Foward8-Reverse1 in Table 2 showed specific amplification (Figure 4A black arrows).\n\nFigure 4. Barcode DNA amplification results from library preparation steps. A. PCR amplification yields consistent results as 174-bp products (arrow). B. Anticipated results from nonspecific PCR amplification. Improper pairs of forward and reverse combination of primers lead to unexpected results in amplification (arrows). We recommend changing the pairs of indexed primer and template DNA when unexpected amplification results are observed. Please see the notes section for our recommended changes to the primer pairs to avoid unexpected amplification products. L: molecular ladder.\n\n67. Prepare > 2 nM sample mixture (if any multiple pairs of PPI) based on the molarity concentration obtained using the Bioanalyzer (pmol/L).\n68.

The expected concentration is approximately 8 nM (1-20 nM) on average. Prepare the premix for PCR. For one reaction: 1 μl of sample, 2 μl RNase-free water, 2 μl 5x primer mix, 5 μl Terra PCR Direct SYBR Premix.\n70. Place the tube in the LightCycler 480 (Roche) and run the following parameters:\n    *   98 °C, 2 min: 1 cycle\n    *   98 °C, 10 s\n    *   60 °C, 15 s\n    *   68 °C, 45 s: 35 cycles\n    *   Hold the sample at 40 °C\n71. Prepare 10 μl of 2 nM sample mixture from Step 68.\n72. Progress to sequencing. Run the MiSeq system in 76 base pair-end mode with the MiSeq reagent Kit v3-150cycle. For sequencing, denature 10 μl of 2 nM sample DNA mixture from Step 71 with 10 μl of 0.2 N NaOH at RT for 5 min.\n73. Add 980 μl prechilled HT1 to the tube containing 1 nM denatured library pool to prepare a 20 pM denatured library.\n74. Use prechilled HT1 from to dilute the denatured 20 pM library solution to 7 pM at a final volume of 600 μl.\n75. Load the prepared library onto the MiSeq cartridge.\n76. Run MiSeq. The sample library which is amplified 174-bp DNA, including the Illumina adapter and index sequence, were applied to the MiSeq system. The running conditions were dualindexed sequencing in a paired-end flow cell, to read 76 bp, including the amplified 38 bp of the barcode sequences. Representative results of MiSeq running are shown in Figure 5. This protocol is also suitable for other platform such HiSeq series in Illumina.\n\nFigure 5. Overview of a MiSeq run using the Sequencing Analysis Viewer (SAV). Representative results of a MiSeq run for a library of protein-protein interactions using barcoded proteins. SAV is an application that allows one to view quality metrics of the sequencing run (details available here). The Flow Cell Chart (left) shows a color matrix of the data quality at each swath (section of flow cell). The flow cell for MiSeq is a single lane flow cell. The Data by Cycle (top middle) shows plots of signal intensities, Q30 score, and base percentages, which can indicate the quality of the sequence data by each cycle. The Data By Lane (bottom middle) shows the density of clusters passing the filter as a percentage of raw cluster density. QScore Distribution (top right) shows the percentage of reads with a QScore. A QScore ≥ 30, the percentage of bases with a quality score of 30 or higher, is positively correlated to the base call quality. A higher QScore indicates a smaller probability of error. A quality score of 30 represents an error rate of 1 in 1,000, with a corresponding call accuracy of 99.9%. A detailed explanation for QScore can be found here.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: Insertional Mutagenesis of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\nBackground: The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) has been used as a reference model for numerous fields of research. Principle research areas are eukaryotic flagellar structure and function, basal bodies (centrioles), cell-cell recognition, cell cycle control, chloroplast biogenesis, phototaxis, nonphotochemical quenching, and especially photosynthesis for C. reinhardtii can grow in the dark on an organic carbon (e.g., acetate), and thus provides advantages over land plants (Harris, 1989; Peers et al., 2009). C. reinhardtii has a short life cycle, a sequenced genome (Merchant et al., 2007), and a growing molecular toolbox for forward and reverse genetic studies, including transformation protocols, gene silencing (Kim and Cerutti, 2009; Molnar et al., 2009), and fluorescent protein-tag (Rasala et al., 2013). There are two commonly used methods for C. reinhardtii transformation – electroporation and glass bead agitation. Electroporation is normally restricted to strains with cell wall, as it kills cell-wall-deficient strains effectively if without careful handling of osmosis. Electroporation also requires special instruments such as electroporator and cuvettes. In contrast, glass bead agitation uses simple lab equipment. The mild shear created by agitation in the presence of glass bead allows cell-wall-deficient strains to take up DNA. If glass bead method is to be applied to cell-wall strains, cells need to be treated with autolysin (http://www.chlamy.org/methods/autolysin.html) to partially lyse the wall components. A pitfall of both methods is that the DNAs are often shortened by nuclease once entering the cells, making the downstream PCR-based genotyping of insertion site rather difficult. Here I describe an improved design of insertional mutagenesis used in (Tsai et al., 2014), and the transformation protocol using glass bead as previously described in (Kindle, 1990) with minor modification. The putative mutants can be selected by autotrophic or antibiotic resistance markers, and the disrupted loci can be mapped by methods such as plasmid rescue (Peers et al., 2009) and SiteFinding PCR (Tan et al., 2005).\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. 15 and 50 ml conical tubes\n2. Petri dishes (90 mm in diameter)\n3. pHYG3 plasmid (http://chlamycollection.org/plasmid/phyg3/) or plasmid carrying other selection markers\n4. C. reinhardtii cell wall-less strain such as dw15 (cw15, nit1, mt+; http://chlamycollection.org/strain/cc-4619-cw15-nit1-mt-dw15-1/)\n5. Agar (Caisson Laboratories, Phytoblend)\n6. TAP medium (Harris, 1989)\n7. Restriction enzyme for linearizing the plasmid DNA, such as PvuII (New England Biolabs)\n8. Hygromycin (Life Technologies) or other selection means\n9. TAP agar plates (see Recipes)\n10. Top agar (see Recipes)\n\nRecipes:\n1. TAP agar plates 0.8% agar with 10 μg/ml hygromycin\n2. Top agar TAP medium with 0.4% agar\nEquipments: 1. Common bench-top vortexer\n2. Spectrophotometer for optical density (OD) measurement, Z2 Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter) or a hemocytometer\n3. 250 ml flask\n4. Bench-top centrifuge capable of centrifugation at 1,500 x g and accommodating 50 ml conical tubes\n5. Shaker\n6. Z2 Coulter Counter or hemocytometer\n7. Glass beads 425-600 μm (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: G8772)\n8. Glass tubes or round bottom plastic tubes with or without cap (~10 mm in diameter)\nProcedures: A. Growth condition\nIn general, cells were grown in liquid TAP medium under continuous light (70-80 μmol/m-2 s-1) at 22 °C, with shaking at 100 rpm; or ambient room temperature (~22 °C) for solid media.\n\nB. DNA preparation (assumes use of pHYG3)\n1. Digest pHYG3 plasmid (http://www.biologie.uni-regensburg.de/Genetik/Mages/pHyg3.html) DNA with PvuII. PvuII was chosen specifically for pHYG3 plasmid because it releases a DNA fragment that contains the hygromycin B resistance gene aph7 with short flanking sequences. Based on our experience and others, linear DNAs are often shortened on each end after entering the cells of C. reinhardtii ranging from dozens to hundreds of nucleotides due to the exonuclease activity. It makes it harder to map the disrupted loci because the precise sequence of the insertion is unpredictable and different in each clone. Hence, we recommend using a DNA fragment that is just enough to cover the selectable marker (i.e., promoter, coding sequence, and terminator), so if the transformed DNAs are shortened to an extent that compromises the integrity of the marker, the clones harboring them will not be pulled out of the screen. In other words, the clones in the mutant library have the insertion whose length lies between the PvuII-digested fragment and the combined length of promoter, coding sequence, and terminator.\n2. Gel-excise the shorter, 2,012-bp fragments of the pHYG3 plasmid.\n\nC. Glass bead transformation\n1. Grow cultures in TAP media (50 ml in 250 ml flask) until cell density reaches 1-2 x 10^6 cells/ml determined by Z2 Coulter Counter or hemocytometer, or approximately 0.2~0.3 OD550 by spectrophotometer.\n2. While cells are growing, prepare hardware: add ~0.3 g (~300 µl) glass beads to test tubes, autoclave.\n3. Pellet the cells by centrifugation (1,500 x g for 2 min), and resuspend in TAP to a concentration of ~2 x 10^7 cells/ml.\n4. Transfer 0.3 ml of cells to the glass bead-containing test tube, add ~1 µg linearized plasmid DNA prepared earlier (see Procedure B DNA preparation), and vortex 15 sec at top speed (Note 2).\n5. Add 6 ml TAP to the test tube, carefully transfer the cells (6 ml + 0.3 ml) to a new sterile 15 ml conical tube, and shake under growth conditions overnight (Note 3) at 100 rpm.\n6. After overnight recovery, add 6 ml of top agar (microwave to melt the top agar, cool to ~40 °C before pouring into the overnight culture) into the overnight culture (1:1 mixture). Mix gently.\n7. Immediately pour the 1:1 mixture onto TAP plates (6 ml for one regular Petri dish, 2 Petri dishes needed), let set (Note 4).\n8. Wrap plates with parafilm (cut slits to allow gas exchange), and place under lights. Colonies should start appearing in 5 to 7 days on the plate surface or embedded within the top agar layer. Generally speaking, 50 ml of culture (step C1) produces approximately 500 colonies after transformation. To create a mutant library ranging the entire C. reinhardtii genome (about 18,000 genes), it would require ~100 transformations in order to get a 3 fold coverage. Use sterile toothpicks or pipet tips to pick up the colonies.\nNotes: 1. Transformation by glass beads is only applicable to cell wall-less strains (e.g., dw15, cw15) (Kindle, 1990). For the transformation of cell-wall strains, electroporation is more commonly used (https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/A14258).   \n2. Do not vortex the cells too vigorously otherwise DNA fragments tend to break, especially for longer fragments.   \n3. If cell duplication during the overnight shaking (Procedure C, step C5) is a concern (e.g., to avoid duplicated clones for mutant screen), do 8-12 h shaking instead.   \n4. Optional: Pre-warm the agar plates at 37 °C before pouring the 1:1 mixture (Procedure C, step C7)."

    "text": "Experiment Name: Heparan Sulfate Identification and Characterisation: Method I. Heparan Sulfate Identification by NMR Analysis Susan M. Carnachan and Simon F.R. Hinkley*\nBackground: Heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) may be purified from complex biological matrices and are often isolated in sub-milligram quantities but not unequivocally identified by spectroscopic means. This protocol details a methodology to rapidly assess the gross compositional features and approximate purity of HS by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. A complimentary method for identification and characterisation of heparan sulfate can be found at Carnachan and Hinkley (2017).\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Thermo ScientificTM, catalog number: 3456)\n2. 5 mm NMR tubes (Norell, catalog number: XR-55TM-7)\n3.

Heparanoid (from porcine mucosa) (New Zealand Pharmaceuticals, batch number: BX-090-010)\n9. Deuterium oxide (99.9 atom%) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, catalog number: DLM-4-100)\n10. Tert-butanol (t-BuOH, ACS reagent) (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number: 360538)\nEquipments: 1. NMR spectrometer (Bruker, model: Bruker Avance DPX-500)\n2. Freeze drier (Eyela, model: FD-1)\n3. Pipettors (0.5-10 μl, 20-200 μl and 100-1,000 μl) (Eppendorf)\n4. Software: Topspin 2.6\nProcedures: 1. Sample preparation\nExchangable protons in the sample are treated to a deuterium exchange regime before NMR analysis:\na. Add D2O (1 ml) to a sample (\\~12 mg) of the glucosaminoglycan in an Eppendorf tube and agitate the sample to complete dissolution.\nb. The sample is freeze dried in the ‘loosely capped’ tube and this process repeated twice more.\nc. Finally, the sample is made up with D2O (0.7 ml) containing 0.2 mg/ml t-BuOH as an internal reference (δ 1H 1.24 ppm) and transferred to the NMR tube for analysis.\n\n2. Sample concentration\nThe concentration of 17 mg/ml has been found to be the minimum necessary for highly reproducible 2-dimensional NMR. The 1H NMR spectra of this class of compound is significantly affected by pH, cross-linking capable species (e.g., Ca2+) and the salt form of the sulfated moieties (Liu et al., 2009; Guerrini et al., 2008). If such contamination is suspected, the sample should be converted to the sodium salt and dialysed (3,500 MW cutoff) against water exhaustively, before freeze-drying and deuterium exchange.\n\n3. Data collection\na. Spectra were collected at 30 °C on a three-channel Bruker Avance III 500 (installed August 2007). Proton frequency was 499.843 MHz and the probe was a Bruker two channel 5-mm broadband observe nuclei probe (31P-109Ag) equipped with actively shielded 50-G/cm Zaxis Pulsed Field Gradients (PFG).\nb. Data acquisition used a spectral width of 10,302 Hz, 65,536 data points, 30-degree excitation pulse, 32 transients, each with a 2-sec delay time and an FID acquisition time of 1.59 sec.\nc. Spectra with solvent-suppression were recorded: low-power continuous-wave presaturation was followed by a composite-observe pulse utilizing the ‘zgcppr’ Bruker sequence (software Topspin 2.6).\n\n4. Data analysis\na. The individual GAG’s are readily identified by their distinctive 1H NMR spectra. Figure 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra (D2O, 25 °C, with HDO suppression, referenced to t-BuOH) of heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfate, where Chondroitin-A is a mixture of chondroitins A&C. The presence of contaminating chondroitin or dermatan sulfate in a sample of heparan sulfate or heparin is apparent by examination of the glycosaminoglycan acetate resonances (Carnachan, 2016). For both heparin and heparan sulfate this acetate resonance occurs at δ 2.034 ppm and any additional acetate resonance downfield indicates the presence of other GAG’s (see Figure 2, which shows the 1H NMR spectra of the acetate methyl resonances (D2O, 25 °C, with HDO suppression, referenced to t-BuOH) of heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfate, where Chondroitin-A is a mixture of chondroitins A&C). In addition, heparin and heparan sulfate have resonances at δ 3.25, 3.37 and > 5.0 ppm that distinguish them from chondroitins or dermatan.\nb. By way of demonstration, 1H NMR spectra that are typical of those recorded during a purification process from Heparanoid (see Note 6) are presented in Figure 3. Figure 3 displays the 1H NMR spectra of Heparanoid and partially purified fractions obtained from DEAE-Sepharose chromatographic separation, including: A. Very crude Heparanoid with significant protein contribution; B. Heparanoid - different batch to A; C and D. GAG mixtures that have a significant proportion of heparin-like materials; E. Fraction that is > 85% HS (D2O, 25 °C, with HDO suppression [discontinuous peak at δ 4.6 ppm], referenced to t-BuOH).\nc. The co-occurrence of the heparin and heparan sulfate N-acetate methyl resonances at δ 2.034 ppm make using this peak for assessing the relative proportion of these species in a sample problematic. However, the intensity of this peak relative to the remainder of the spectrum can be indicative of whether a sample is more heparan sulfate-like, or, more heparin-like. The peak height for the acetate resonance of heparin is equivalent to the peak height of the methine resonances observed at δ \\~3.8 ppm, while for heparan sulfate the acetate resonance is \\~2.5 fold greater than the methine resonances (see Figure 2). Low levels (even up to < 15%) of contaminating heparin in a sample of heparan sulfate are very difficult to confirm or quantitate by 1H NMR (Keire et al., 2010), and are more readily assessed using 2-D NMR techniques (Guerrini et al., 2005).\nd. A semi-quantitative purity assessment can be undertaken for samples containing primarily one GAG (> 90%). Using a known concentration of t-BuOH in D2O and a pure sample of a particular GAG a standard curve may be generated. GAG was weighed out accurately into \\~10, 5, 2 and 0.5 mg aliquots and made up with exactly 1.0 ml of t-BuOH standard solution for NMR analysis. Using integrated areas, the ratio of the acetate peak of the GAG divided by the t-BuOH resonance plotted against the known amount of GAG in solution generates a straight-line relation (Figure 4, which is a standard curve plotting the ratio of acetate and internal-standard resonances (integrated areas from 1H NMR) against the known mass of HS (> 95% w/w) in the sample (t-BuOH standard solution 0.20 mg/ml)). A sample of unknown purity made up in the same concentration and volume of t-BuOH solution can therefore be assessed for purity compared to the reference material. Such a standard curve is particularly useful in assessing possible contributions from salt and water concentrations that are effectively invisible to this NMR analysis and not trivial to measure in a non-destructive manner on small samples (< 5 mg).\nNotes: 1. GAG’s, either as a dry lyophilized solid or as a dilute solution (D2O, 5 °C) are stable indefinitely (> 5 yr). Dry solids appear to undergo no degradation over time either at room temperature (RT) or freezer conditions (to -70 °C).   \n2. Completing the D2O exchange process has only a subtle effect on the NMR spectra, and so for routine analysis or during purification-monitoring this step is often omitted.   \n3. Concentrated samples (> 60 mg/ml) (prepared for example for 13C analysis or rapid 2-D NMR techniques) exhibit significant line broadening and chemical shift changes in the 1H NMR spectrum, thus reference 1H NMR must be recorded as dilute solutions only.   \n4. We have demonstrated in the laboratory that freshly lyophilized HS will adsorb 13% w/w of water on standing. This is a reproducible mass gain on standing and readily-reversible process by lyophilization. Samples are routinely stored at -70 °C and so are allowed to warm to RT in airtight containers before exposure to the atmosphere to minimize water uptake during handling.   \n5. The presence of salts can be subjectively noted by the physical appearance of the GAG. Heparin and HS are fluffy white ‘cotton-wool’ like solids. The presence of salt at \\~> 10% w/w generates a more rigid, tough off-white solid which adsorbs atmospheric water at an accelerated rate compared to the de-salted material. This is particularly important to note for weighing small amounts of HS that are subsequently entering a dose-response bioassay.   \n6. Heparanoid is a complex mixture of GAG’s recovered from the side-streams produced in the production of Heparin from porcine mucosa. The composition of material described as Heparanoid varies significantly (see Figures 3i and 3ii), dependant on which side-streams of the Heparin process are combined. Thus the levels of protein, individual GAG’s (including Heparin), salts and other biological materials can vary wildly in individually sourced materials and discrete batches. One method (Shworak, 2001) of purifying HS is partitioning on a diethylaminoethylSepharose (DEAE-Sepharose) column. Column elution may be achieved by step-wise increments in ionic strength (e.g., sodium chloride in phosphate buffer). For analysis by NMR fractions are desalted (dialysis), lyophilized and the resultant amorphous white solid exchanged with D2O before 1H NMR spectra recorded (unpublished work)."

Image Studio Lite (LI-COR)\n2. SoftMax Pro (Molecular Devices)\nProcedures: 1. Generation of infectious subviral particles (ISVPs)\n    a. Propagate and purify reovirus virions as previously described (Berard and Coombs, 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2010). Using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, determine particle concentration by measuring the optical density of the purified virus stocks at 260 nm (OD260; 1 unit at OD260 = 2.1 x 10^12 particles/ml) (Smith et al., 1969).\n    b. In 1 tube of an 8-well tube strip, dilute 2 x 10^11 virions into 90 µl of ice cold VB (see Recipes).\n    c. Add 10 µl of ice cold 2 mg/ml TLCK-treated chymotrypsin (see Recipes) to the diluted virus. Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times. Note: For an undigested control, substitute 10 µl of ice cold VB for 10 µl of TLCK-treated chymotrypsin.\n    d. Incubate the reaction for 20 min at 32 °C in a thermal cycler. Note: Under these conditions, σ3 is degraded (Joklik, 1972; Borsa et al., 1973a) and µ1 is cleaved (Nibert and Fields, 1992; Chandran et al., 1999).\n    e. Following digestion, quench chymotrypsin activity by the addition of 1 µl of 100 mM PMSF (see Recipes). Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.\n    f. Incubate the reaction for 20 min on ice.\n    g. To confirm that ISVPs are generated, run 2 x 10^10 particles per lane on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini gel. Run the gel for 40-45 min at 200 V constant.\n    h. Visualize the protein bands by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (see Data analysis, Figure 1).\n    i. Store ISVPs on ice, and use within 2-3 h for hemolysis experiments.\n\n2. Preparation of bovine red blood cells (RBCs)\n    a. Perform all steps on ice or at 4 °C.\n    b. Transfer 1 ml of citrated bovine calf blood to a microcentrifuge tube. Note: Citrated bovine calf blood should be used within 2 weeks of the draw date.\n    c. Pellet the RBCs by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min. Note: RBCs are the source of membranes for hemolysis experiments.\n    d. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.\n    e. Resuspend the RBCs in 1 ml of ice cold PBSMg (see Recipes). Mix by gently pipetting up and down.\n    f. Repeat Steps 2c-2e until the supernatant remains clear after pelleting.\n    g. Resuspend the washed RBCs in ice cold PBSMg at a 30%(vol/vol) concentration. Mix by gently flicking the side of the tube. Note: Estimate the RBC pellet volume by using the volume markers on the microcentrifuge tube.\n    h. Store RBCs on ice, and use immediately for hemolysis experiments.\n\n3. ISVP-induced hemolysis assay\n    a. In separate microcentrifuge tubes, assemble the following reactions on ice:\n        i. 33.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs (0% hemolysis control)\n        ii. 30.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs + 3 µl 10% TX-100 (100% hemolysis control, see Recipes)\n        iii. 3.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs + 30 µl ISVPs\n    b. Mix the reactions by gently flicking the side of the tubes.\n    c. Incubate the reactions for 1 h (T3D reovirus) or for 2 h (T1L reovirus) at 37 °C in a water bath. Note: Under these conditions, ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion is induced (Chandran et al., 2002; Sarkar and Danthi, 2010) and the µ1-derived pore forming peptides are released (Nibert et al., 1991; Chandran et al., 2002; Odegard et al., 2004; Nibert et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Agosto et al., 2006; Ivanovic et al., 2008).\n    d. Place the reactions on ice for 20 min.\n    e. Pellet intact RBCs by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min. Note: This step should be performed at 4 °C.\n    f. Transfer 20 µl of each supernatant to individual wells of a 96-well plate.\n    g. Dilute each transferred supernatant with 80 µl of VB. Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.\n    h. To quantify the amount of hemoglobin released (i.e., RBC lysis), measure the absorbance (A) of the diluted supernatants at 405 nm using a microplate reader. A values are recorded on SoftMax Pro software.\n    i. Calculate the percent hemolysis (see Data analysis).\n\n4. Data Analysis\n    a. Generation of infectious subviral particles (ISVPs)\n        i. Record and analyze the results using a gel imaging system and Image Studio Lite software. Figure 1 shows an SDS-PAGE gel of reovirus virions and ISVPs.\n        ii. Virions contain λ1,2,3, µ1C, σ2, and σ3.\n        iii. ISVPs contain λ1,2,3, µ1C, δ, and σ2.\n        Note: The appearance of δ, the loss of µ1C, and the loss of σ3 indicate the transition from virions to ISVPs. λ1,2,3 and σ2 should remain unchanged.\n    b. ISVP-induced hemolysis assay\n        i. All hemolysis experiments should be repeated for at least three independent replicates.\n        ii. Calculate the percent hemolysis using the following formula:\n            [(Asample - Abuffer)/(ATX-100 - Abuffer)] x 100\n            - Abuffer represents the supernatant derived from VB and RBCs.\n            - ATX-100 represents the supernatant derived from VB, RBCs, and TX-100.\n            - Asample represents the supernatant derived from VB, RBCs, and ISVPs.\n        iii. When comparing the hemolytic capacity of different reovirus strains, calculate P values using Student’s t-test.\n        iv. Use graphing software to plot percent hemolysis.\n        Note: For T3D reovirus, 40-60% hemolysis is typically observed after 1 h incubation at 37 °C.\nNotes: 1. When possible, all procedures are performed in a BSL-2 certified tissue culture hood.   \n2. Laboratory personnel should use appropriate PPE.   \n3. All solid waste is autoclaved prior to disposal.   \n4. All liquid waste is inactivated with 50% bleach prior to disposal."

    "text": "Experiment Name: Analyzing the Properties of Murine Intestinal Mucins by Electrophoresis and Histology Ran Wang and Sumaira Z. Hasnain*\nBackground: Specialized secretory cells known as goblet cells in the intestine and respiratory epithelium are responsible for the secretion of mucins. Mucins are large heavily glycosylated proteins and typically have a molecular mass higher than 106 Da. These large proteins are densely substituted with short glycan chains, which have many important functional roles including determining the hydration and viscoelastic properties of the mucus gel that lines and protects the intestinal epithelium. In this protocol, we comprehensively describe the method for extraction of murine mucus and its analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis. Additionally we describe the use of High Iron Diamine-Alcian Blue, Periodic Acid Schiff’s-Alcian Blue and immune–staining methods to identify and differentiate between the different states of glycosylation on these mucin glycoproteins, in particular with a focus on sulphation and sialylation.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

Biochemical analysis of mucins and mucus\n\n1. Mice are euthanized using cervical dislocation according to approved ethical guidelines by the host institute in a PC2 laboratory.\n2. Mice are sprayed with 70% ethanol to avoid the contamination of samples with hair.\n3. A mid-line incision is made using scissor in the abdominal cavity.\n4. The intestine is pulled out gently using curved tweezers. Intestines are cut at the end attached to the stomach and the rectum end and dissected out. Small intestine, caecum and colon should be kept separately for analysis.\n5. Two different types of analyses can be conducted: total mucus present in the murine intestine to assess the overall changes in the mucus barrier, or the secreted mucus which covers and protects the intestinal epithelium.\n\n   For secreted mucus extraction from mouse intestine:\n   a. Place the intestine in a 10 cm Petri dish. Gently flush the intestines with PBS, to remove fecal matter, using a syringe with a 19.5 gauge needle through one open end. The amount of PBS will vary depending on the mouse strain and/or the part of intestine that are used. Usually up to 5 ml is used for colon, 7 ml for the small intestine and approximately 3-4 ml for the caecum. This material is discarded unless required for microbiota analyses.\n   b. Place the intestine in a new Petri dish and flush the intestine slowly 5 times with 3 M urea (2 ml each flush) to obtain the secreted mucus from the lumen of the intestine. 3 M urea is recommended, as higher concentrations of urea or the use of GuCl would result in disrupting the intestinal epithelial cell layer. The material isolated is viscous; therefore use a plastic transfer pipette to transfer the material to a 15 ml Falcon tube on ice.\n   c. Intestinal tissue is processed for histology (as described in Procedure B–histochemical analysis of mucin glycoproteins) before (a small section from the intestine) and after flushing (the whole intestine is rolled) with urea to ensure that only the secreted mucus was isolated and the intestinal crypts remained intact.\n\n   For total mucus extraction from mouse intestine:\n   a. Place the intestine in a 10 cm Petri dish. Gently flush intestine with PBS, to remove fecal matter, using a syringe with a 19.5 gauge needle through one open end. It is important to ensure that the intestine is only gently flushed; otherwise the secreted mucus layer will be lost. The amount of PBS will vary depending on the strain of mice and/or the part of intestine that are used. Usually up to 5 ml is used for colon, 7 ml for the small intestine and approximately 3-4 ml for the caecum. This material is discarded as it consists of insoluble fecal matter and negligible amounts of secreted mucus (as has been previously investigated by the authors, the faecal mucin matter is not detected via Western blotting).\n   b. Cut intestine open longitudinally using a spring scissor. Once open, scrape off the residual mucus, using a cell scraper. This will remove the mucins present in the goblet cells as well as the secreted mucus layer and represents the total intestinal mucus.\n   c. The mucus is transferred to a 15 ml Falcon tube and solubilized in 6 M GuCl reduction buffer (see Recipes) at 4 °C overnight by rotation using a Beckman Coulter 15 ml rotator. GuCl is a strong chaotrope and denatures proteins and is recommended for the solubilisation of total mucus isolated from animals. Once solubilized, store sample at -80 °C until required later.\n\n6. Separation of mucins by agarose gel electrophoresis:\n   a. The total mucus and or secreted mucus can now be analysed using agarose gel electrophoresis.\n   b. Before gel electrophoresis, reduce mucus samples with 50 mM DTT for 2 h at 37 °C to break up the disulphide bonds.\n   c. After reduction, add 0.125 M iodoacetamide to the mucus sample and incubate for 30 min at room temperature in the dark to carboxymethylate mucus, to prevent reformation of the disulphide bonds.\n   d. Up to 3 ml of the isolated samples in GuCl can then be dialyzed in 3-6 M urea using D-TubeTM dialyzers (Mw cut-off of 14 kDa or below is sufficient). Dialysis to urea is essential as GuCl has a very high salt content.\n   e. 10% (v/v) loading buffer (see Recipes) is added in samples before electrophoresis.\n   f. Samples are electrophoresed on 0.7-1% (w/v) agarose gels (around 5-7 mm in thickness) in TAE buffer (see Recipes) with 0.1% SDS at 30 V for 15 h (Thornton et al., 2000). (Refer to Figure 1 for electrophoresis gel tank and power supply setup).\n   g. After electrophoresis, transfer mucins onto a nitrocellulose membrane by vacuum blotting in 4x SSC running buffer (see Recipes) at a pressure of 45-50 mbar using a 785 Bio-Rad Vacuum Blotter (Sheehan and Thornton, 2000) for around 1.5-3 h. (Refer to Figure 2 for the Vacuum Blotting Unit setup). To ensure a tight seal, 0.7% agarose can be used to seal the sides of the gel during the vacuum blotting process. Once the entire loading dye has disappeared from the gel, the vacuum blotting process is stopped and the gel is disposed. Note, vacuum blotting consistently results in efficient mucin protein transfer and is the recommended method. The nitrocellulose membrane is carefully removed using tweezers and can be analysed by using three distinct methods (as described in steps A7-A9).\n\nTo determine the changes in the glycosylation of mucins, two separate methods can be utilized which are described in detail below. Periodic Acid Schiff’s-Alcian blue staining can differentiate between acidic and neutral mucins, whereas High Iron Diamine-Alcian Blue staining can be used to identify the changes in mucin sulphation and sialylation.\n\n7. Glycoprotein detection using PAS staining:\n   a. Volumes of reagents used in this protocol are dependent on the size of the nitrocellulose membrane and should be sufficient to cover the membrane completely.\n   b. Wash nitrocellulose membrane with dH2O.\n   c. Incubate nitrocellulose membrane with periodic acid solution (see Recipes) at room temperature for 30 min. Periodic acid will oxidise the vicinal diols in mucin glycoproteins.\n   d. Wash membrane thoroughly with dH2O to remove the periodic acid solution.\n   e. Nitrocellulose membrane is incubated with sodium metabisulphite solution (see Recipes) for 5 min, the solution is discarded and this step is repeated once more. This step is essential to reduce background staining.\n   f. Add Schiff’s reagent to the membrane and incubate for approximately 10-15 min at room temperature. The vicinal diols in mucin glycoproteins exposed by periodic acid will react with the Schiff’s reagent to give a purple-magenta colour.\n   g. Rinse membrane with sodium metabisulphite solution, followed by a wash with dH2O to stop the reaction.\n   h. Air-dry nitrocellulose membrane before taking scanning using Odyssey® CLx Imager and densitometry analyses (Thornton et al., 1994). Figure 4 shows a scanned nitrocellulose membrane stained with PAS and anti-Muc2 antibody. Total mucus from the colon was extracted from 4 individual C57BL/6 mice and analysed using 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was stained with PAS (A) or anti-Muc2 antibody (B, H300, from Santa Cruz) and developed using infrared-labelled secondary antibody. The membrane was scanned using the Odyssey® CLx Imager.\n\n8. Detection of sulphated glycoprotein using High Iron Diamine (HID):\n   a. Volumes of reagents used in this protocol are dependent on the size of the nitrocellulose membrane and should be sufficient to cover the membrane completely.\n   b. Wash nitrocellulose membrane with dH2O.\n   c. Incubate nitrocellulose membranes with HID solution (see Recipes) for 18 h at room temperature.\n   d. Wash membrane in dH2O and air-dry before scanning using Odyssey® CLx Imager (Hasnain et al., 2017).\n\n9. Immunodetection of mucin proteins:\n   a. Volumes of reagents used in this protocol are dependent on the size of the nitrocellulose membrane and should be sufficient to cover the membrane completely.\n   b. Wash nitrocellulose membrane briefly in TBST buffer (see Recipes).\n   c. Block membrane with milk blocking buffer (see Recipes) or Odyssey blocking buffer for at least 30 min at room temperature (alternatively membrane can be kept in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight).\n   d. Wash membrane 2 times with 15 min incubation for each wash using TBST buffer.\n   e. Incubate with anti-Muc2 antibody (diluted in blocking buffer) overnight at 4 °C.\n   f. Wash membrane 2 times with 5 min incubation for each wash using TBST buffer.\n   g. Incubate with appropriate secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature.\n   h. For horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies, peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG is incubated with membrane at 1 in 10,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Membrane is then washed 3 times with 5 min incubation for each wash using TBST buffer. Incubate membrane with enhanced chemiluminescence western detection reagent for approximately 2 min and then washed to remove excess and subsequently expose nitrocellulose membrane to BIOMAXTM BML film in the dark and develop.\n   i. For the phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody, phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG is incubated with membrane at 1 in 10,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 times washes in TBST buffer, membrane is then incubated with nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT)/5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3yl phosphate substrate for 5 min to develop.\n   j. For infrared fluorescent dyes labelled antibodies, IRDye® 800CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG is incubated with membrane at 1 in 2,000 dilution in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. After 3 times washes in TBST buffer, nitrocellulose membranes can be directly scanned at 700 or 800 nm using Odyssey® CLx Imager (as shown in Figure 4B).\n\nB. Histochemical analysis of mucin glycoproteins\n\n1. ‘Swiss Roll’ technique:\n   a. Dissect the intestine as described in steps A1-A4. Figure 5 illustrates the mouse intestine dissection and ‘Swiss Roll’ technique for histology: Mouse intestine is dissected (A) followed by opening longitudinally using spring scissor (B) and removing feces using a P200 tip (C).\n   b. Roll the intestine around a 16 gauge needle with the help of tweezers starting from the rectum end (Figures 5D and 5E).\n   c. The roll is then pinned onto a small piece of polystyrene using 30 gauge needles (Figure 5F) and placed in fixative solution (4% PFA or 10% neutrally buffered formalin Figure 5G) for 24 h (Reilly and Kirsner, 1965).\n   d. Fixed Swiss roll is transferred into histology cassette (Figure 5H) for paraffin embedding (Figure 5I).\n\n2. Tissue processing:\n   a. Swiss rolls are transferred to embedding cassettes and placed in 70% ethanol.\n   b. Process specimens using the Micro Spin Tissue processor (STP) 120. Specimens then go through series of solvents (1 change of 70%, 90%, 95% ethanol, 3 changes of 100% ethanol, 3 changes of xylene and 3 changes of paraffin) for a total of 8 h before being embedded in wax.\n   c. Paraffin cell blocks can be stored at room temperature until cut to a thickness of 4 µm sample using Micron Cool Cut HM355S microtome with microtome blade MX35.\n   d. Sections are floated in a warm water bath (37.4 °C) before being positioned on microscope slides, dried at 37 °C overnight and stored at room temperature until use.\n\n3. Periodic Acid Schiff’s-Alcian Blue (PAS-AB) staining:\n   a. Before staining, slides are rehydrated by going through xylene and ethanol gradient for 5 min in each solution (2 changes of xylene, 2 changes of 100% ethanol, 1 change of 95% and 70% ethanol). Rehydrated slides are placed in PBS for further staining.\n   b. Place slides in AB solution for 5 min and then wash briefly in ddH2O. AB stains sulphated and sialylated glycoproteins.\n   c. For staining of neutral glycoproteins, incubate the slides with 0.1 M potassium hydroxide in dH2O for 30 min at room temperature.\n   d. Place slides in 1% periodic acid solution (see Recipes) for 5 min followed by a thorough wash in ddH2O to remove the acidic solution.\n   e. The slides are then placed in Schiff’s reagent for 10 min and washed again in ddH2O.\n   f. All slides are washed under running dH2O for 10 min and counterstained with haematoxylin for 30 sec.\n   g. Slides are washed in hot ddH2O (warm ddH2O at high power, 30 sec in microwave) for 15 to 30 sec.\n   h. Slides are placed in ethanol gradients (from 70% to 100%) and xylene for dehydration, mounted using Pertex mounting medium and sealed with cover slips. Figure 6 shows pictures of PAS-AB stain in small intestine, proximal colon and distal colon of C57BL/6 mice. Neutral glycoproteins are stained in magenta (red arrow, depicting the glycocalyx), mucins that are both acidic and neutrally charged are stained in purple (blue plus magenta stain, green arrow) and acidic glycoproteins are stained in blue (black arrow). These slides were counterstained with haematoxylin (as described in step B3f). Scale bars = 200 µm (low power), 100 µm (high power).\n\n4. High Iron Diamine-Alcian blue (HID-AB) staining:\n   a. Prepare HID solution freshly every time within 4-6 h of use (as described in Recipes).\n   b. After the slides are passed through the xylene and ethanol gradient as described in step B3a, slides are incubated with HID for 18 h at room temperature. HID will stain sulphated mucins in black.\n   c. Wash slides with ddH2O thoroughly to remove the HID staining solution.\n   d. Place slides in AB solution for 30 min (Spicer, 1965), which will stain sialylated mucins.\n   e. No counterstaining is required; therefore slides are mounted as above (described in step B3h). Figure 7 shows HID-AB staining in distal colon of C57BL/6 mice. Black stain indicates sulfomucins dominated area (left panel, red arrow), whereas goblet cells with sialomucins (blue) and mixed sulfo-sialomucins (black and blue colors in the right panel, red arrows). Scale bars = 200 µm (low power), 100 µm (high power).\n\nData analysis\n\n1. Densitometry analysis for mucin gel:\n   a. 2-3 biological samples should be included for quantification from each group.\n   b. To quantify the band intensity of mucin gel, Image StudioTM Lite software is used. Multiple regions of interest with the same size are drawn over each mucin bands using the object drawing tool in the software. Intensity of bands is automatically calculated by software as arbitrary number. The number can be used for further comparison between groups.\n\n2. Quantification of histological staining:\n   a. Quantification is conducted on blinded samples.\n   b. To quantify positive staining in tissue sections after histological staining, multiple pictures (usually 3-4 pictures) from one mouse should be taken. Pictures are taken randomly in areas with longitudinally sectioned crypts using an Olympus bright field microscope with a 40x lens in order to keep sampling process unbiased (although pictures can be taken with any lens, it is essential to keep the sampling procedure consistent). It is important to ensure longitudinally sectioned crypts are quantified, as it limits the variation, artifacts and the possibility of false negative staining.\n   c. In each image, positive staining is defined by RGB pixel picking tool in NIS-Elements software v.3.0. Clicking the positive stained area using RGB pixel picking tool enables the software to pick areas that are positive for the exact same staining. This is achieved by defining the actual RGB pixel of the positive stained area. Background staining usually with a slightly lighter color (different pixel) will not be picked up by the software. The percentage of the longitudinally sectioned crypt area occupied by positive staining is calculated (Figure 8) for multiple crypts within each specimen and the average for that specimen determined, and used for statistical analysis. Figure 8 illustrates the quantification of positive staining by using NIS-Elements software. A. Original picture showing Muc2 positive staining in dark brown color. B. Positive staining was defined by RGB pixel picking tool in NIS-Elements software. For example, to quantify goblet cell volume in a longitudinally sectioned crypt, the percent of positive staining per crypt is calculated as the area covered by positive staining divided by the area of the crypt. Three to five individual crypts are analysed for each sample before taking the average value.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: Single-cell Damagenome Profiling by Linear Copying and Splitting based Whole Genome Amplification (LCS-WGA)\nBackground: Spontaneous DNA damage frequently occurs on the human genome, and it could alter gene expression by inducing mutagenesis or epigenetic changes. Therefore, it is highly desired to profile DNA damage distribution on the human genome and identify the genes that are prone to DNA damage. Here, we present a novel single-cell whole-genome amplification method which employs linear-copying followed by a split-amplification scheme, to efficiently remove amplification errors and achieve accurate detection of DNA damage in individual cells. In comparison to previous methods that measure DNA damage, our method uses a next-generation sequencing platform to detect misincorporated bases derived from spontaneous DNA damage with single-cell resolution.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1.

(2016). After staining, single nuclei are resuspended in 500 μL of cold 1× PBS.\n\nD. Single cell isolation by mouth pipetting\n1. Preparation of glass capillaries: Flame the center until the glass pipette softens. Then, remove the glass pipette from the flame and quickly pull to generate the capillaries, usually \\~3-fold longer than the original glass pipette length. After pulling, bend the glass pipette until the thin middle part breaks.\n2. Prepare the aspirator tube assembly using the glass capillary. Figure 2 shows the aspirator tube assembly with the glass capillary for mouth pipetting.\n3. Prepare the single cell suspension with 1× PBS, as described above.\n4. Drip a few PBS drops (3 μL per drop) on the microscope slide (4 drops per slide) and place the slide under the microscope (10× field).\n5. Add the cells to one PBS drop and perform a serial dilution, by transferring the cells from one drop to another via mouth pipetting.\n6. When only one cell is in the field, pick the cell and deposit it into the PCR tube with 2 μL of lysis buffer (see Recipe 1) via mouth pipetting. Video 1 shows single cell picking under microscopy.\n\nE. (Alternative) Single cell isolation by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)\n1. Prepare the single cell suspension with 1× PBS.\n2. (Optional) Cells can be stained with Hoechst 33342, to facilitate gating.\n3. Set up the FACS machine in plate mode and single-cell purity.\n4. Sort the single cells into PCR tubes with 2 μL of lysis buffer (the PCR tubes can be placed on a full skirted 96-well PCR plate, or a regular rack for PCR tubes).\n\nF. Cell lysis (estimated time: 90 min)\n1. Lyse cells in 2 μL of lysis buffer at 30°C for 90 min.\n2. Add 2 μL of stop buffer (see Recipe 2) to each cell, to neutralize the lysis buffer.\n3. After briefly spinning down, the single-cell lysate can be stored at -80°C for future use. Safe stopping point: The single-cell lysate can be stored at -80°C for up to 3 months.\n\nG.

Map the sequencing reads to GRCh37 (hg19) by BWA-MEM with default settings. This step is performed on each of three split libraries independently.\n2. Call variants by using GATK 3.8 (HaplotypeCaller) with the BAM files from all three split libraries as the input. Duplicate reads are kept by using the -drf DuplicateRead option. The reads with no stored bases are filtered out with the -filterNoBases option. Discard the reads with mapping quality score lower than 50 with the -mmq option, as well as the reads with base quality lower than 20, with the -mbq option. The ploidy number (-ploidy) is set as 10, for detecting variants at low allele frequency. The output variants include both germline variants and de novo variants.\n3. Apply a python script to filter out the variants that are only detected in one split library. Figure 5 shows the IGV screenshots show the criteria of variant calling. (A) The variants detected in at least two splits and not detected in the bulk data are called as true de novo variants. (B) The examples of potential false positives caused by misalignment or sequencing errors in the genomic regions with repetitive sequences. Such variants are filtered out in the analysis.\n4. Identify de novo variants with the following criteria: a. The variant is not detected (zero reads) in the bulk sequencing data. b. The corresponding locus is covered by at least ten reads in the bulk sequencing data.\n5. To avoid potential false positives caused by misalignment, discard the de novo variants 1) within the tandem repeats, 2) within the regions close to centromeres/telomeres, 3) three-base next to the indels, 4) within the homopolymers or the regions with low complexity. The related filter files: cento.bed and hg19_tandem.bed file are provided in the Github website. After the effective filtering of amplification errors, the de novo variants are mainly composed of damage-associated single-nucleotide variants (damSNVs).\n6. The related customized scripts are available at https://github.com/zonglab/LCS-WGA-code.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: A Novel Gene Stacking Method in Plant Transformation Utilizing Split Selectable Markers\nBackground: Gene stacking, the process of introducing multiple genes into a single plant to enhance desired traits, is essential for plant genetic improvement through both conventional breeding and genetic transformation. In general, transformation-based gene stacking can be achieved through either co-transformation to simultaneously introduce multiple genes or sequential multi-round transformation. While co-transformation is generally faster and more efficient than sequential multi-round transformation, it often requires two selectable marker genes, which confer resistance to antibiotics, for selecting transgenic events. However, in most cases, there is only one best selectable marker gene for a specific plant species or genotype. Also, it is harder to optimize the concentrations of two antibiotics for co-transformation than using one antibiotic for selecting transgenic events. To overcome this challenge, we recently developed an innovative split selectable marker system for plant cotransformation, allowing the use of one selectable marker gene to select transgenic events. This method involves constructing two binary vectors, each carrying a subset of genes of interest and a partial fragment of the selectable marker gene, which is connected to a partial intein fragment. Following Agrobacterium-mediated cotransformation, plants harboring both binary vectors are selected using a single antibiotic, such as kanamycin. This split-marker system can be used to co-transform multiple genes into both herbaceous and woody plants, accelerating genetic improvement of polygenic traits or integrative improvement of multiple traits to simultaneously increase crop yield and quality.\nMaterials & Reagents: Reagents:\n1.

    "text": "Experiment Name: Differentiation of Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)–derived Mesenchymal Progenitors into Chondrocytes\nBackground: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from human sources are valuable tools for studying skeletal development and diseases, as well as for potential use in regenerative medicine for skeletal tissues such as articular cartilage. To successfully differentiate human iPSCs into functional chondrocytes, it is essential to establish efficient and reproducible strategies that closely mimic the physiological chondrogenic differentiation process. Here, we describe a simple and efficient protocol for differentiation of human iPSCs into chondrocytes via generation of an intermediate population of mesenchymal progenitors. These methodologies include step-by-step procedures for mesenchymal derivation, induction of chondrogenic differentiation, and evaluation of the chondrogenic marker gene expression. In this protocol, we describe the detailed procedure for successful derivation of mesenchymal progenitor population from human iPSCs, which are then differentiated into chondrocytes using high-density culture conditions by stimulating with bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) or transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGFβ-3). The differentiated iPSCs exhibit temporal expression of cartilage genes and accumulation of a cartilaginous extracellular matrix in vitro, indicating successful chondrogenic differentiation. These detailed methodologies help effective differentiation of human iPSCs into the chondrogenic lineage to obtain functional chondrocytes, which hold great promise for modeling skeletal development and disease, as well as for potential use in regenerative medicine for cell-based therapy for cartilage regeneration.\nMaterials & Reagents: # Biological materials\n1.

ImageJ (Version 1.5.1)\n3. 7500 software (Version 2.1.0)\nProcedures: # A. Thawing and recovering human iPSCs\n1. Pre-warm an appropriate volume of mTeSRTM Plus medium to room temperature in a 50 mL Falcon tube (refer to Note 1).\n2. Prepare the Geltrex-coated 6-well plates at least 1 h before iPSC thawing.\n3. Retrieve the cryogenic vial containing frozen iPSCs from the liquid nitrogen promptly and place it in a 37 °C water bath.\n4. Hold the cap of the cryogenic vial and gently swirl it to thaw the cells, ensuring that the cap remains above the water level.\n5. Once most cells are thawed and only a few ice crystals remain, remove the cryogenic vial from the water bath, spray it with 70% ethanol, and transfer it to a laminar hood.\n6. Carefully open the cap of the vial and transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL Falcon tube containing the 10 mL pre-warmed Ham’s F12 nutrient mix.\n7. Rinse the cryogenic vial with 1 mL of F12 medium and add the solution to the same Falcon tube, gently mixing the cells by pipetting.\n8. Centrifuge the Falcon tube at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\n9. Gently resuspend the iPSC pellets in 2 mL of mTeSRTM Plus medium by gently pipetting up and down 3–4 times using 1 mL pipette tips, being cautious not to break the iPSC colonies into single-cell suspension.\n10. Add 2 μL of ROCK inhibitor (1,000× stock solution) to the cell suspension to enhance iPSC survival (refer to Note 3).\n11. Prepare a 6-well plate by removing the excess Geltrex from the pre-coated 6-well plate and then wash the wells with 2 mL of 1× DPBS. Aspirate the PBS and slowly transfer the iPSC suspension into the plate. Distribute one cryogenic vial of iPSCs into 1–2 wells of the 6-well plate.\n12. Gently tilt the culture plate back and forth and move it left and right several times to disperse cells evenly across the entire well (refer to Note 4).\n13. Incubate the plate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and allow the cells to culture overnight.\n14. The following day, replace the medium with fresh mTeSRTM Plus medium, excluding the Rock inhibitor Y-27632.\n15. Subsequently, change media every day, replacing with fresh 2 mL of mTeSRTM Plus medium per well in the 6-well plate. Allow the iPSCs to grow for 4–5 days. Upon reaching 70%–80% confluence, the cells can be passaged (refer to Note 5).\n\n# B. Passage iPSCs using ReLeSR method\nTypically, we pass iPSCs every 4–5 days, when they reach a confluence of 70%–80% and can be passaged as cell aggregates. For the passaging of iPSCs as cell aggregates, ReLeSR is routinely employed in our protocols (refer to Note 6). mTeSRTM is an enzyme-free reagent that selectively detaches undifferentiated cells and generates optimal-size aggregates.\n1. Before initiating the protocol, ensure that new 6-well plates are coated with Geltrex at least 1 h in advance. Additionally, pre-warm the required volume of mTeSRTM Plus medium to room temperature.\n2. Carefully aspirate the spent medium from the wells containing cells and perform a single wash with 2 mL of DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. No selective removal of differentiated regions of iPSCs is necessary.\n3. Add 1 mL of ReLeSR into each well of the 6-well plate. Swirl the plate gently to ensure uniform distribution of ReLeSR over the entire cell surface. Within one minute, aspirate the ReLeSR solution from the wells.\n4. Add 1 mL of mTeSRTM Plus medium to each well of the 6-well plate and monitor cell dissociation under an inverted microscope.\n5. Once iPSCs start to exhibit separation and rounding up at the periphery, they are ready to be removed from the wells using a cell lifter.\n6. Gently pipette the cell mixtures up and down 5–6 times to disperse large colonies into small clumps. Collect all resulting cell aggregates into a 15 mL tube (refer to Note 8).\n7. Centrifuge the 15 mL tube at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Add 2 mL of mTeSRTM Plus medium to the cell aggregate in 15 mL tube.\n8. Prepare the 6-well plate by removing any remaining Geltrex solution from the pre-coated plate. Wash the plate once with 2 mL of 1× PBS to remove any remaining Geltrex.\n9. Transfer the 0.5 mL of mTeSRTM Plus medium containing cell aggregate to each well of the 6-well plate and uniformly distribute the cell aggregate onto the plate surface. Add 1.5 mL of mTeSRTM Plus medium to each well to make a total volume of 2 mL. Generally, after 80% confluence of iPSC colonies, we pass the cells into 1:4 split ratio.\n10. Supplement the culture system with 2 μL of Rock inhibitor Y-27632 (1,000×, working concentration 10 μM) to enhance the survival of iPSCs.\n11. Gently tilt and move the plate in quick back and forth and side to side motions to evenly distribute the cell aggregates across the plate surface. Subsequently, return the plate to the 37 °C incubator (refer to Note 10).\n12. Daily, refresh the mTeSRTM Plus medium and observe the cultures under suitable conditions to monitor growth until the subsequent passaging or banking (refer to Note 11).\n\n# C. Derivation of mesenchymal progenitors (MSCs) from iPSCs using direct plating method\nWe have devised a streamlined and effective protocol for the feeder-free differentiation of iPSCs into MSCs in a controlled culture system.\n1. Before initiating the differentiation process, coat each well of a 6-well plate with 1 mL of 0.1% gelatin solution and allow it to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. Subsequently, wash the coated plates once with 1× PBS.\n2. Remove the mTeSRTM Plus medium from the routine iPSC cultures in 6-well plates and wash the cells with sterile PBS. Apply 1 mL of ReLeSR to each well and gently swirl the plate to ensure even coverage of the cell surface. Within a minute, aspirate the ReLeSR solution from the wells.\n3. Add 1 mL of mTeSRTM Plus medium to the wells and, using a cell lifter, remove the colonies from the plate. Gently pipette the cell mixtures up and down 3–4 times to break down large colonies into smaller clumps. Collect all resulting cell aggregates into a 15 mL tube.\n4. Centrifuge the 15 mL tube at 300× g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant. Wash the cell aggregates with 1× PBS and then add 1 mL of mesenchymal stem cell induction and growth medium (referred to as MSC growth medium) to each tube.\n5. Plate the iPSCs onto gelatin-coated 6-well plates. Employ a cell culture split ratio of 1:1 or 1:2, where cells harvested from one well are distributed onto one or two new wells. This step marks the initial passage, referred to as iPS-MSCs or iMSCs passage 0 (p0).\n6. Change the medium every 2–3 days. After 7–10 days, the cultures will exhibit a mixture of flattened cuboidal and elongated spindle-shaped cells, indicating successful differentiation (refer to Note 12). Once a confluent monolayer is attained, proceed to the next passage.\n7. Apply 0.5 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution to each well of a 6-well dish and incubate at 37 °C for 3–5 min. Use repeated pipetting with a 1 mL pipettor to singularize the cells. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube containing MSC growth medium. Centrifuge the cells at 300× g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\n8. Resuspend the cell pellet in MSC growth medium and perform cell counting. Prepare a cell suspension at a concentration of 0.25 × 10^6 cells/mL. Plate 1 mL of the cell suspension into each well of a 6-well culture plate, which has been precoated with gelatin solution. This will mark the iPS cell-MSCs (iMSCs) passage 1.\n9. Maintain the cells in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C, with medium changes every 2–3 days. Within two weeks, the cells will adopt a fibroblastic, spindle-like morphology indicative of mesenchymal progenitor cells. Differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into mesenchymal progenitors (iMSCs) using direct plating methods is shown, with a scale bar of 100 μm (Figure 2). When cultures reach 90% confluence, split the cells using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution and seed them at a density of 1 × 10^4 cells/cm^2 onto gelatin-coated plates.\n10. Assay the expression of stem cell genes (e.g., Oct4, Nanog, alkaline phosphatase, Klf4) and gene markers associated with the mesenchymal lineage (e.g., Twist1, Col1a1) by quantitative RT-PCR, as described below in step H. Notably, stem cell genes will be suppressed in the mesenchymal-like population, while mesenchymal markers will be significantly induced.\n11. For routine expansion, seed the cells at a density of 1 × 10^4 cells/cm^2 and maintain them in MSC growth medium (see Note 14). Keep track of the passage numbers. Establish a cell bank by freezing batches at each passage. At harvest, resuspend singularized cells in 1× cryopreservation medium and aliquot 1 × 10^6 cells per vial. Freeze the vials at -80 °C and subsequently transfer them to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage (see Note 15).\n\n# D. MSC surface antigens analysis by flow cytometry\nThe iPSC-derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSC-MSCs or iMSCs) exhibit comparable surface antigen expression to human bone marrow–derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). For the analysis of surface antigens, antibodies targeting human CD34, CD45, CD73, CD90, and CD105 can be employed (refer to Antibodies section). Human bone marrow–derived MSCs serve as positive control cells, while the negative markers include CD34- and CD45-, and the positive markers comprise CD73+, CD90+, and CD105+.\n\n## Protocol for flow cytometric analysis of surface antigens\n1. Prepare the MSC single-cell suspension as described in steps C7–C9.\n2. Gently break the cell pellets through finger tapping and resuspend the cells using cold 1% FBS in DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+.\n3. Count the total number of cells using a hemocytometer and adjust the cell density to 2 × 10^6 cells/mL.\n4. Transfer 2 × 10^5 cells (100 μL cell suspension) into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes (refer to Note 18).\n5. Add the appropriate volume of MSC antibodies (refer to Antibodies section) to each tube and gently mix them by pipetting.\n6. Incubate the cell samples for 30 min at room temperature in the dark.\n7. After the incubation, wash the cells once with 1% FBS in DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Finally, resuspend the cell samples in 250 μL of 4% formaldehyde-DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+.\n8. Analyze the cell samples using a flow cytometer (refer to Note 20) to evaluate surface antigen expression as described in our previous paper (Khan et al., 2023).\n\n# E. Cryopreserving iPSC-MSCs (iMSCs)\nFollowing serial trypsinization, the induced pluripotent stem cell–derived mesenchymal stem cells (iPSCMSCs or iMSCs) exhibit an enhanced maturation state, rendering them amenable to cryopreservation after passages 3–5.\n1. Prepare fresh 2× MSC freezing medium and keep it on ice until use.\n2. Obtain a single cell suspension of MSCs using the Trypsin-EDTA method, following the procedures detailed in steps C7–C9.\n3. Gently dislodge the cell pellets through finger tapping and resuspend the cells in MSC growth medium to achieve a single-cell suspension.\n4. Using a hemocytometer, perform cell counting and adjust the cell density to 2 × 10^6 cells/mL.\n5. Add an equal volume of cold 2× MSC freezing medium to the MSC cell suspension, ensuring thorough mixing.\n6. Aliquot 1 mL of the cell mixture into each cryogenic vial. Each cryogenic vial should contain 1 × 10^6 cells (refer to Note 17).\n7. Swiftly place the cryogenic vials into the freezing container and maintain them at -80 °C overnight.\n8. The following day, transfer the cryogenic vials containing cells to a -80 °C freezer or a liquid nitrogen tank for sustained long-term storage.\n\n# F. Differentiation of iPSC-MSCs (iMSCs) into chondrocytes\nThe iPSC-MSCs (iMSCs) demonstrate a versatile capacity for multipotent differentiation encompassing osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis. In this study, we explored two distinct in vitro methods for differentiating iMSCs into chondrocytes, as described below.\n\n## Micromass method for differentiation of iMSCs into chondrocytes\n1. Expand human iMSCs in a 10 cm culture dish in MSC growth medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until they reach 75%–80% confluence.\n2. Aspirate culture medium and wash the cells once with 10 mL of PBS. Subsequently, apply 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA solution to the culture dish (refer to Note 21). Return the dish to the 37 °C incubator and incubate for approximately 3–5 min. Upon detachment of the cells, pipette gently and repeatedly using a 1 mL pipettor to disperse the iMSCs into single cells.\n3. Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL sterile conical polypropylene tube containing MSC growth medium. Centrifuge the cells at 300× g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\n4. Resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of MSC growth medium and perform gentle pipetting using a 1 mL pipettor to make single-cell suspension. If required, pass the cell suspension through a 40 μm nylon cell strainer.\n5. Cell counting is done using the Trypan Blue exclusion method with a hemocytometer and Trypan Blue solution or by employing an automated cell counter. Cells are subsequently diluted in MSC growth medium to achieve a final concentration of 25 × 10^6 cells/mL.\n6. For seeding, apply 10 μL drops of the diluted cell suspension onto 6-well culture plates (see Note 22). Add up to three high-density cell spots per well of a 6-well dish, ensuring adequate spacing between the drops. These micromasses represent structural condensation of iMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation. Figure 3A shows the formation of three micromasses, which are equally spaced in the 6-well plate (see Note 23).\n7. Allow the cells to attach for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Following attachment, carefully apply 1.5 mL of MSC growth medium containing 10 μM of ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to each well. Return the plate to the cell culture incubator and maintain overnight.\n8. After 24 h, aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of chondrogenic differentiation medium to each well. Continue incubation at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator.\n9. On day 2, add fresh chondrogenic differentiation medium containing BMP-2 or TGFβ3 to each well. Replace the growth factor-supplemented medium every other day.\n\n## Pellet formation method\n1. To initiate chondrogenic differentiation using the pellet formation method, harvest the iPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Following centrifugation of the cells at 100× g, resuspend them in MSC growth medium.\n2. Perform viable cell counting via microscopy on a hemocytometer or other cell counting equipment using Trypan Blue solution in a 1:2 dilution of the cell suspension from step 1. Aliquot 2.5 × 10^5 viable iMSCs in 0.5 mL of MSC growth medium into 15 mL conical tubes for pellet cultures. Centrifuge the cells at 100× g for 1 min and incubate them in the 15 mL conical tubes overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with loosened caps to facilitate gas exchange.\n3. Within 24–48 h of pellet formation, verify that the cells have formed a spherical pellet at the bottom of each 15 mL tube. Figure 4 indicates the condensation of cells in the form of 3D-pellet culture at the bottom of 15 mL conical tube. If cells do not form a pellet under these conditions, coat a 15 mL conical tube with anti-adherence rinsing solution for 1 h, wash with PBS, and then add cells to allow pellet formation.\n4. Aspirate the medium and replace it with 0.5 mL of chondrogenic differentiation medium supplemented with either BMP-2 or TGFβ3.\n5. Subsequently, culture the pellets in chondrogenic medium with BMP-2/TGFβ3 for 7, 14, and 21 days, with careful medium exchange in each 15 mL conical tube using 0.5 mL of fresh chondrogenic medium containing BMP-2 or TGFβ3 every other day.\n\n# G. Histological assessment of chondrogenic matrix production\n1. Harvest the cell pellets and wash them once in PBS. Subsequently, fix the pellets in formalin solution for a duration of 15 min.\n2. Perform two washes of the fixed pellets in PBS, followed by sequential dehydration steps in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes using 50%, 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol and then ethanol/xylene solution and 100% xylene. Each dehydration step should take 5 min (two repetitions, see Note 24). Embed the dehydrated pellets in low-melt paraffin.\n3. Use a microtome to section the paraffin-embedded pellets, creating sections of 5–7 μm thickness, and mount them onto Superfrost Plus slides.\n4. De-paraffinize and rehydrate the sections on slides by subjecting them to sequential washes in 100% xylene (two repetitions, each for 10 min), 100%, 95%, 70%, and 50% ethanol (two repetitions, each for 2 min), and finally, distilled water (for 5 min).\n5. To detect sulfated proteoglycan deposits indicative of functional chondrocytes, rinse the formalin-fixed sections of paraffin-embedded pellets in an acetic acid solution for 3 min. Subsequently, stain the sections with Alcian Blue solution at room temperature for 30 min. After a brief rinse in acetic acid solution and running tap water for 5–10 min, counterstain the cell nuclei with Nuclear Fast Red Kernechtrot solution at room temperature for 5 min, followed by a rinse in running tap water until clear. Alcian blue staining shows accumulation of proteoglycans, which demonstrate the deposition of extracellular matrix in micromass culture of iMSCs. A high-magnification image demonstrates cellular compaction and condensation indicating the development of cartilage/chondrocytes (Figure 3B and 3C).\n6. For visualization of acidic proteoglycan in cartilage tissues, stain the hydrated formalin-fixed sections of paraffin-embedded pellets with Safranin O solution at room temperature for 5 min. Remove excess stain by rinsing the sections under running tap water for 5–10 min.\n7. Dehydrate the slides in 70%, 95%, and 100% ethanol, then 100% xylene (two repetitions, each for 2 min). Finally, mount coverslips using CytoSeal mounting medium to facilitate microscopic assessment of proteoglycan content, with Alcian Blue staining resulting in diffuse blue dye deposits, and Safranin O staining leading to diffuse orange-red deposits.\n\n# H. Quantitative PCR analyses of cartilage genes\nFor PCR analysis, RNA is extracted from cell pellets collected throughout the chondrogenic differentiation time course (refer to Note 13).\n1. Combine 2–3 pellets per experimental group with 1 mL of TRIzol and transfer the mixture to a sterile, RNase-, DNase-, and pyrogen-free 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\n2. Pass the pellets in TRIzol reagent several times through a 26 1/2-gauge needle attached to a 1 mL syringe. Vortex the sample and incubate it at room temperature for 5 min.\n3. Add 200 μL of chloroform to the sample, vortex for 30 s, and incubate for 5 min.\n4. Centrifuge the samples at 12,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C to achieve phase separation. Place the tubes on ice.\n5. Transfer the upper aqueous RNA layers into a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\n6. Add 500 μL of isopropanol to each sample, mix by inversion, and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min for RNA precipitation. At this stage, samples may be stored at -20 °C for extended periods.\n7. Centrifuge the samples at 12,000× g for 30 min at 4 °C. A small glassy oval/sphere will be strongly adhered to the side of the tube. Place the samples on ice. Wash the RNA pellets with 500 μL of 70% ethanol solution and spin at 12,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant and repeat the washing step two times.\n8. Remove the ethanol and air-dry the RNA pellets. Dissolve the RNA pellets in an appropriate volume of ultrapure nuclease free water.\n9. Measure the RNA concentration for each sample using a NanoDropTM spectrophotometer.\n10. Treat the RNA samples with DNase I as per the manufacturer’s protocol and then perform reverse transcription of RNA to cDNA using the cDNA Reverse Transcription kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol.\n11. Conduct real-time quantitative PCR on the cDNA samples synthesized from total RNA using the SYBR Green Master Mix, along with gene-specific real-time PCR primers and a real-time PCR cycler according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n12. Use the data obtained from quantitative RT-PCR analyses to calculate values represented as 2-ΔΔCt, wherein ΔΔCt refers to the difference in crossing threshold (Ct) values between the experimental and control samples, employing β-actin as an internal standard. Data presented in Figure 5 show high expression of mesenchymal marker genes such as RUNX1 and COL1A1 in AC-iMSCs culture. Figure 5 shows gene expression analyses by qPCR showing expression of mesenchymal genes COL1A1 and RUNX1 in the AC-iMSCs relative to their parental induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). β-Actin served as the housekeeping gene and internal control. Data represented as fold change relative to respective parental iPSCs.\n13. Present the data as mean ± S.E.M. of at least three independent samples. Perform statistical comparisons between untreated and growth factor–treated groups using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. Significance is assigned to P values < 0.05 (see Note 14).\nNotes: None"

You need a 100/120 μl collagen layer/well for a 48-well plate or 80 μl collagen layer/well for an 8 well chamber slide.\n3. Prepare a tube on ice with the following volume of 10x PBS: (final Vol.)/10.\n4. Add the following volume of 1 N NaOH to the tube containing 10x PBS: (Vol. collagen to be added) x 0.023 ml.\n5.

Add the calculated volume of collagen and mix. Leave on ice (stable for 2-3 h) until ready for use.\n8. Coat tissue culture dishes with collagen (use 24/48 wells for quantification of transdifferentiation, protein or RNA extraction, or use 8 well chamber slides for later staining applications).\n9. Allow collagen to solidify at 37 °C (about 30 min).\n\nAcinar Tissue Isolation and Culture:\n1. In the hood, transfer the pancreas into a culture dish containing 10 ml of PBS.\n2. Immediately put the pancreas in culture dish with 5 ml collagenase VIII solution (see Recipe 4) and cut the organ in very small pieces (less than 1 mm of diameter) with a scalpel within 2 min.

Aspirate the pellet in 20 ml wash solution, and transfer the solution in a fresh tube. Do not aspirate up and down!\n16. Centrifuge, 720 x g, 5 min, 18 °C.\n17. Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml culture medium 30% and transfer it on a well of a 6-well culture dish.\n18. Check the quality of isolated acinar tissue under the microscope. Isolation is good if you see clusters of acinar cells (epithelial explants, the morphology is similar to control acinar explants) and only rare isolated acinar cells swimming around. Sometimes damaged acinar cells agglomerate together, remove such sticky agglomerates with a forceps.\n19. Let the isolated acini recover for 60 min in the incubator (37 °C with 5% CO2).\n20. Meanwhile precoat a cell culture plate of the desired size with collagen (as described in the Gelation Procedure above). Calculate the required volume of collagen - medium mixture required for step 24. The volume depends on your application. Calculated 100 μl volume/well for a 48-well plate or 80 μl volume/well for an 8 well chamber slide. Typically you will seed the acinar explants obtained from one wild type mice in 15 wells of a 48 well plate. In this case you need 100 µl x 15/2 = 750 µl collagen and 100 µl x 15/2 = 750 µl medium 0.1%.\n21. Collect the acinar suspension from the plate and transfer it to a fresh 15 ml tube.\n22. Centrifuge acinar suspension, 720 x g, 5 min, 18 °C.\n23. Carefully aspirate the supernatant.\n24. Resuspend the pellet in a mixture of collagen and culture medium 0.1% (1:1 vol./vol.).\n25. Pipette the acini/collagen-medium suspension mixture into each coated well in the plate (at least in triplicate). For the typical 48-well example you pipette 100 µl of the mixture in 15 wells.\n26. Wait until solidification of the collagen (about 30 min).\n27. Add some more collagen (100 µl/well for the 48 well plate). You may skip this step when you will perform immunofluorescence as a downstream application. Wait until solidification (about 30 min).\n28. Add culture medium 0.1% with/without the desired supplements to each well. Typically 400 µl/well for a 48 well plate.\n29. To induce transdifferentiation of acinar explants, add TGFa (10 ng/ml) or EGF (25 ng/ml) into the culture medium 0.1% at day 1-3-5 where day 1 is the day of isolation.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: Artificial Optogenetic TRN Stimulation of C. elegans\nBackground: Optogenetics is a powerful tool for manipulating neuronal activity with high temporal and spatial precision. In the nematode C. elegans optogentics is especially useful and easy to apply. This is because C. elegans is translucent, so its neurons are highly accessible to optic stimulation. In addition, many of its neurons can be exclusively targeted using cell-specific promoters. We have recently taken advantage of optogenetics to deliver artificial patterns of prolonged activation to a class of mechanosensory neurons, called touch receptor neurons (TRNs) in worms that lack touch sensation due to a genetic mutation. Our aim was to examine whether we can counteract the effects of sensory loss by artificially activating the sensory neurons. Here we describe in detail the various components of the protocol that we used. This consists of exposing worms expressing the light-sensitive ion channel Channelrohdopsin 2 (ChR2) in TRNs to long-term random flashes of light.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. 1.7 ml microtubes (Genesee Scientific, catalog number: 24-282)\n2.

Hook-up wires from the LED assembly (black arrowhead) connected to the digital output of an Arduino Uno microcontroller board. In the picture the Arduino board is not connected to the computer.\nTwo pieces of hook-up wire are soldered to the LED assembly to drive current through it. The LED assembly is attached to the circular beam optic and together they are mounted to the top of the opaque cardboard box. The LED is connected to an Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller. One wire is attached to the ground and the other to digital output number 12. The Arduino microcontroller is connected to the computer via USB cable.\n\nSoftware:\n1. Arduino software (https://www.arduino.cc) (Available for free online)\n2.

Matlab 2014R (Mathworks, http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)\n4. Custom written Matlab script called Led3.m, provided as an appendix.\nProcedures: 1. Prior to blue light stimulation, 10 worms are transferred from the 6-cm cultivation plate to a 3-cm seeded stimulation plate including ATR. The lid of the plate is removed (so that it does not interfere with the light) and the plate is placed inside the optical stimulation box. Then stimulation is started by running the Led3.m Matlab script.\n2. The reversing assay is based on a well-established protocol (e.g., Tsalik and Hobert, 2003). Each worm is first transferred to an area in the plate that is free of food in order to release bacterial remainders from its body. As soon as there is no visible trail of food, the worm is placed on a 6-cm unseeded NGM test plate. Prior to the assay, the test plate is left for 1 h with its lid off to dry its surface. 1 min after transferring the worm to the test plate, the number of reversal events is counted over a duration of 3 min. A reversal was counted only if it consisted of at least two consecutive head bends while the worm reversed.\n3. In each testing round, four to six worms of each genotype are picked from the 3-cm stimulation plate either immediately, after no flashing at all or 2 h after the end of the flashing session, and their reversing rate off food is measured. The assay is repeated on at least three different testing days, and in each testing day all genotypes are equally represented.\nNotes: 1. C. elegans behavior varies considerably as a function of its environmental conditions. We noticed that reversing rate might change dramatically from day to day. A key parameter affecting reversing rate was the dryness of the test plate. There was also differential variability in reversing between the mechanosensory mutants and wild-type worms. Here a key factor was temperature. In order to overcome this variation and cancel out its effects, each experiment is spread out over several testing days."

    "text": "Experiment Name: Novel Cross-Species Salivary Gland Parasympathetic Neuron Coculture System\nBackground: The parasympathetic nervous system is essential for salivary gland development and functionality. Parasympathetic neuron (parasymN) innervation is the main neural network that controls salivary secretion. Therefore, an exclusive model to study parasympathetic neurons and salivary gland tissue circuitry will significantly improve the understanding of the role of parasymN activation on salivary regulation. Harvesting primary rodent parasymNs is challenging due to their body-wide disbursed location. Similarly, the salivary glands are distributed in various locations around and within the oral cavity. Here, we present a coculture model system using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived parasymNs and primary mouse von Ebner’s gland cells. We previously reported the first protocol to robustly generate human parasymNs from hPSCs through the Schwann cell precursor (SCP) lineage. The hPSC-parasymNs are functional and have been applied to model several autonomic disorders. We also used a Sox10-Cre::tdTomato (hereafter referred to as RFP) reporter mouse line, which labeled von Ebner’s glands, a type of minor salivary gland connected to the trough of circumvallate and foliate taste papillae. This labeling allowed for visualization and efficient isolation of primary tissues in young adult mice (8–10 weeks). By coculturing the two tissues, human parasymNs control mouse salivary gland cell growth and activation. Both parasymNs and primary salivary gland cells can be frozen and stocked at early stages of differentiation and isolation, making applications easier. This novel coculture model system could also be used to model and study related human diseases in the future, such as dry mouth syndrome.\nMaterials & Reagents: # Biological materials\n1.

Euthanize the 8-week-old Sox10-Cre::RFP mice by placing them in a CO2 chamber. Ensure mouse death by cervical dislocation.\n2. Place the mouse in the surgical area. Wet the mouse head using 70% ethanol to disinfect the surface and prevent fur from getting into the oral cavity.\n3. Decapitate the mouse. Hold the head in one hand and open the mouth cavity by pulling the skin over the skull and below the mandible. Figure 1 illustrates opening the mouse oral cavity, showing a ventral view of a mouse head (A) and a mouse head with the mouth cavity widely open (B).\n4. Cut the corners of the mouth along the cheek using dissecting scissors to further open the oral cavity.\n5. Dissect the tongue with the mandible and remove the skin covering the mandible. Transfer the tongue on the mandible to 30 mL of fresh sterile DPBS (Ca+2 and Mg+2 free) in a 50 mL tube. Wash five times using DPBS. Figure 2 shows a dissected tongue with the mandible, a representative image of the dorsal view of an adult mouse tongue sitting on the mandible. A black dotted line encircles the single circumvallate taste papilla in the midline of the posterior tongue. Scale bar: 500 µm.\n6. Using surgical forceps to hold the tongue under a dissecting microscope, inject \\~0.5 mL of the tongue tissue separation solution (a mixture of Collagenase A and Dispase II enzymes) into the subepithelial space of the posterior tongue as described [17] and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. Figure 3 illustrates intralingual injection of tongue tissue separation solution, showing the entry and location of the needle for injecting the solution into the posterior part of the tongue (A), a dorsal view of the posterior tongue after 0.5 mL solution injection (B), and a dorsal view of the posterior tongue after 15 min of incubation at 37 °C (C). Black dotted lines encircle the single circumvallate taste papilla. Scale bars: 500 µm.\n7. After the incubation, dissect the posterior tongue region with RFP+ von Ebner’s glands. Use small scissors to cut the epithelium of the circumvallate papilla region, then use fine forceps to peel off the epithelium of the circumvallate papilla region. Figure 4 shows peeling the circumvallate epithelium, with a brightfield image of the dorsal view of the posterior tongue region after removing part of the epithelium (A), where a black dotted line outlines the cutting edge of epithelium in the circumvallate papilla area with the epithelium removed. Figure 4B shows a brightfield image of the ventral view of the peeled epithelium, with a white dotted line encircling the circumvallate papilla epithelium. Scale bars: 500 µm in A; 100 µm in B.\n8. Under a fluorescent stereomicroscope, the RFP+ von Ebner’s glands were visible in the circumvallate region. Dissect and collect \\~0.1 mL of von Ebner’s salivary gland tissue in the surrounding of the circumvallate papilla under the fluorescent microscope. Figure 5 shows dissection of von Ebner’s gland tissue from Sox10-Cre::RFP mice, with an RFP fluorescent image of the dorsal view of the posterior tongue region under the fluorescent stereomicroscope (A), where bright RFP+ glands were readily visible in the regions surrounding and under the circumvallate papilla. A white dotted line in A encircles the circumvallate papilla. White dashed squares encircle the circumvallate papilla-adjacent regions from which glands were collected. Figure 5B shows an RFP fluorescent image of two pieces of dissected tissue enriched RFP+ Ebner’s glands (white arrowheads). Scale bars: 500 µm.\n9. Wash the salivary glands in 15 mL of fresh sterile DPBS in a 100 mm sterile culture dish.\n\n## B. Salivary gland cell dissociation\n1. Transfer salivary glands into a 35 mm dish.\n2. Use fine-tip scissors to cut the salivary gland tissues into small pieces. Figure 6 shows tissue pieces of Ebner’s glands after mincing. RFP+ Ebner’s gland tissue was cut into smaller pieces using fine scissors under a fluorescent stereomicroscope. Arrows point to a few pieces of RFP+ Ebner’s gland tissue after mincing. Scale bar: 200 µm.\n3. Incubate the tissue pieces in 3 mL of salivary gland cell dissociation solution (0.25% trypsin-EDTA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Gently agitate the tissues every 5 min using 1 mL pipette tips. Do not cut the tip, as the sharp edge of the cutting end may injure the cells.\n4. Add 1 mL of dissociation termination solution to stop the reaction and transfer all of the solution with cells into a 5 mL low-binding vial.\n5. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 450× g for 10 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant as much as possible. Be careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\n6. To completely remove the remaining trypsin-EDTA, repeat step B4, adding 1 mL of dissociation termination solution to suspend the cells. Then, repeat step B5 for the centrifugation.\n7. Remove the supernatant and leave one-fourth of the medium (250–300 µL) without disturbing the pellet and filter the cells using a 70 µm cell strainer, followed by a 35 µm cell strainer.\n8. Collect the filtered cell suspension and proceed straight to Section C. Figure 7 shows the cell suspension, with photomicrographs of the dissociated cells and some small cell clusters from RFP+ Ebner’s glands. Scale bar: 100 µm.\n\n## C. Salivary cell passaging\n1. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 200× g for 5 min.\n2. Aspirate the medium.\n3. Wash cells twice with PBS (1 mL/24-well, 3 mL/6-well, and 4 mL/10 cm plates).\n4. Add prewarmed (5 min in a water bath) trypsin-EDTA (1 mL/24-well, and 3 mL/10 cm plates).\n5. Incubate for 5 min in a 37 °C incubator.\n6. Pipette gently with a P1000 pipette 3–5 times to fully dissociate the cells.\n7. Transfer the trypsin-EDTA and cell solution to a conical tissue culture tube that contains at least 5 times higher volume of salivary gland cell medium.\n8. Centrifuge at 200× g for 5 min.\n9. Resuspend the cells with 1 mL of salivary gland cell medium.\n10. Count the cells.\n11. Replate the cells on desired tissue culture plates at 15 × 10\\^3/cm\\^2 density with salivary gland cell medium (0.5 mL/24-well, 2 mL/6-well, and 7 mL/10 cm plates).\n12. Change the medium the next day, and every 2–3 days after (1 mL/24-well, 3 mL/6-well, and 10 mL/10 cm plates).\n13. Cells should reach >80% confluency in one week and will be ready for replating/freezing. The ideal passage number of the cells for the experiment is P3–8. Figure 8 shows cell morphology of salivary gland cells after replating, with brightfield images showing the isolated salivary gland cells after 24 h (A and A’) and 4–6 days (B and B’).

Pipette gently with a P1000 pipette 3–5 times and fully dissociate the cells. Test if cells are ready for dissociation by gently pipetting 1–2 times. If more times are needed, incubate 5 more minutes each time and test for up to 30 min.\n6. Transfer the Accutase and cell solution to a conical tissue culture tube that contains at least 5 times higher volume of PBS.\n7. Centrifuge at 200× g for 5 min.\n8.

Transfer the Accutase and cell solution to a conical tissue culture tube that contains at least 5 times higher volume of PBS.\n7. Centrifuge at 200× g for 5 min.\n8. Resuspend the cells with day 10–16 medium.\n9. Count the cells.\n10. Replate the cells on 24-well ultra-low attachment tissue culture plates at 1 × 10\\^6/well density with SCP differentiation, D10–16 medium (0.5 mL/well).\n11. Add day 10–16 medium on the next day (0.5 mL/well), which makes the total volume 1 mL.\n12. Feed cells on days 13 and 15 by full medium change. In order to keep all the cells, tilt the plate and aspirate the medium slowly. Always keep the tip on the surface of the culture medium away from the cells. Figure 10 shows cell morphology during Schwann cell precursor (SCP) differentiation, with a cartoon illustration of the method to change medium in suspension cultures (A) and brightfield images showing the differentiated D16 SCP spheroids (B). Scale bar = 200 µm.\n13. On day 16, SCPs should be differentiated in suspending spheroids.\n\n# III. Coculture\n\n## H. SCP replating for parasymN differentiation/coculture\n1. Please make sure you have 80% confluent salivary cells at passages 3–8 before proceeding.\n2. On day 16, tilt the plate and collect all the SCP spheroids in the culture medium into a conical tissue culture tube and fill up the tube with PBS (at least the same volume of cell suspension).\n3. Centrifuge at 200× g for 3 min.\n4. Aspirate the supernatant and add Accutase to the spheroids (1 mL for less than 12 wells, 2 mL for less than 24 wells).\n5. Transfer the Accutase that contains the spheroids back to a low attachment well.\n6. Incubate for 20–30 min in 37 °C incubator.\n7. Gently pipette the spheroids with a P1000 pipette, transfer the cells to a conical tissue culture tube, and fill up the tube with PBS.\n8. Centrifuge at 200× g for 5 min.\n9. Resuspend the cells with 1 mL day 16 parasymN medium.\n10. Count the cells.\n11. Replate SCP cells at a density of 1 × 10\\^5/cm\\^2 on top of 80% confluent salivary cells (passage 3–8) in a 24-well plate containing 0.5 mL parasymN differentiation medium.\n12. Fully change the medium on the next day and every 2–3 days after (1 mL/24-well plates).\n13. After 7–10 days, aggregated cell bodies of parasymNs should be observed on the salivary cell layer with well-developed neurites. Figure 11 shows cell morphology of the coculture, with brightfield images showing the cell bodies (indicated by the yellow arrows) and the axons (indicated by the red arrows) of hPSC-parasymNs on the salivary cells (indicated by the white arrow) 10 days after the coculture.

High-speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter, model: Avanti J25)\n2. Spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, model: DU800)\n3. Fluorometer (OLIS Clarity; model: OLIS-SLM-Aminco 8100) and quartz fluorescence cuvettes (Fisher 14-958-128)\n4. Typhoon Biomolecular Imager (GE/Amersham, model: 8600)\nProcedures: This methodology is predicated on locating sites in the primary structure of OM or soluble binding proteins that tolerate Cys substitution and chemical modification with extrinsic fluorophores. Using either crystallographic data or structural models [e.g., from the MODELLER algorithm of CHIMERA (Pettersen et al., 2004)], accessible sites are predicted. Single Cys residues are genetically engineered at those locations, and the resulting Cys mutant proteins are subjected to labeling with fluorophores. Regardless of the basis of such predictions, the extent of labeling and biochemical functionality of each construct must be experimentally verified. Consequently, for each protein of interest, 4–6 candidate target residues are selected, mutagenized to substitute Cys, and evaluated for expression, susceptibility to alkylation with different maleimide fluorophores, and overall sensitivity to interactions with ligands.\n\nFor a protein whose tertiary or quaternary structure is fully delineated, candidate residues are picked with side chains that project near its ligand binding site, such that adsorption of a ligand may result in the quenching of an attached fluorophore. For example, Escherichia coli FepA (EcoFepA) binds the siderophore ferric enterobactin (FeEnt) in the loops of its surface vestibule (Smallwood et al., 2014). Its crystal structure (Buchanan et al., 1999) correctly predicted that Cys mutant proteins EcoFepA_S271C and EcoFepA_A698C are accessible to fluoresceination, and then sensitive to FeEnt binding (Smallwood et al., 2014). For Klebsiella pneumoniae IroN (KpnIroN), which is not yet structurally solved but has 82% identity to EcoFepA, the guideline that >25% sequence identity predicts an identical overall protein fold (Ginalski, 2006; StokesRees and Sliz, 2010) was relied upon. To determine labeling targets in KpnIroN, CLUSTALW was used to align it with EcoFepA [PDB sequence 1FEP (Buchanan et al., 1999)], and then the MODELLER of CHIMERA (UCSF) was employed to predict KpnIroN tertiary structure, including surface loops. This led to the selection and engineering of mutant KpnIroN_T210C, located in L2, that is quantitatively modified by FM (Chakravorty et al., 2019).\n\nAs a general approach, PCR is used to clone a binding protein of interest from the chromosomes of a particular bacterial species. When the sensors originate from E. coli OMPs, the nucleotide sequences encoding their mature proteins are cloned and inserted downstream from the native promoter of EcofepA in pITS23 (Scott et al., 2001), which is a derivative of the low-copy pHSG575 (Takeshita et al., 1987). Cys substitution mutants in proteins may be generated by a variety of methods; QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent) of the wild-type genes on pITS23 (Ma et al., 2007) is used, with complementary oligonucleotides flanking the mutation, following the manufacturer’s instructions. After confirming the mutations by sequencing (Genewiz) of purified plasmids, the sensor proteins are expressed and fluorescently labeled in intact cells, which may be stored frozen at -70 \\°C. If the desired sensor derives from a soluble binding protein, then the relevant structural genes are cloned in plasmid pET28a, which adds a 6-histidine (6H)-tag at either the N- or C-termini of the mature protein, and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography (Talon Superflow, Takara Bio Inc.).\n\nAlthough other plasmid systems are likely also acceptable, the vector for OMP production, pITS23 (Scott, 2000), carries wild-type EcofepA under control of its native, Fur-regulated promoter. For expression of other E. coli OMP sensors, EcofepA in pITS23 is precisely replaced with the alternate OMP structural gene (with its own signal sequence), such that the iron-regulated EcofepA promoter controls biosynthesis of the OM protein. For OM proteins of other bacterial species, the sequence encoding mature EcoFepA is replaced with the sequence encoding the foreign, mature OM protein, downstream from the EcoFepA signal sequence, and regulated by the EcofepA promoter. This approach allows for the EcoFepA signal sequence to direct secretion and assembly of the foreign OMP in the E. coli OM. Next, appropriate conditions for high-level expression of the OM sensor proteins of interest are chosen. The E. coli host OKN1359 is utilized, because its inability to make enterobactin (entA) or to transport iron (\\ΔtonB) leads to overexpression of iron-regulated sensor proteins during growth in iron-deficient MOPS media (Chakravorty et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2022). Additionally, OKN1359 is devoid of several OM proteins (\\Δfiu, \\ΔfepA, \\Δcir), which facilitates expression of foreign OM proteins. The Cys mutant constructs are exposed in situ, in living cells, to FM or other fluorophore maleimides (e.g., coumarin maleimides and Alexa Fluor maleimides). The expression and labeling of each cloned OMP is evaluated by growing bacteria harboring the appropriate plasmid construct in MOPS medium to late log phase (A600 nm = 2.5–3.5), and analyzing SDS-PAGE resolved samples, or performing immunoblots of bacterial OM or soluble purified protein fractions, to visualize the production and extent of modification of the sensor proteins. For soluble binding proteins, a 6H-tagged Cys mutant protein is purified from cell lysate by metal affinity chromatography (e.g., Talon Superflow, Takara Bio Inc.), modified with FM or other fluorophore maleimides, and re-purified the fluorescently labeled sensor by acetone precipitation or gel filtration chromatography.\n\nStep-by-step protocol:\n1. Grow sensor strains to maximize Cys-mutant OMP expression, or purify soluble Cys-mutant binding proteins. For modifications with fluorophore maleimides, inoculate bacteria harboring plasmids that encode a Cys mutant OMP from frozen stocks into LB, grow the strain with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 \\°C overnight, and subculture at 1% into MOPS minimal media with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 \\°C for 10–12 h, until late exponential phase.\n2. For bacteria, determine cell density from absorbance at 600 nm; for purified proteins, determine the concentration from absorbance at 280 nm.\n3. Collect bacterial cells by centrifugation at 7,500 \\times g for 15 min; wash with and resuspend in the same volume of 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7. Repeat. For soluble binding proteins, dialyze the solution of purified protein (1–5 mg/mL) overnight, using appropriate molecular weight–cutoff tubing or membrane, against 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7.\n4. Prepare fluorescein 5' maleimide (FM) stock solution: Use a micropipettor tip to transfer a small amount of FM powder to 0.5 mL of anhydrous DMF or DMSO. Determine the concentration of this stock solution from its absorbance at 488 nm in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8 (\\εmM = 80). The stock solution may be stored at -20 \\°C.\n5. Labeling reaction: Calculate the appropriate dilution factor of the stock, and then label the bacterial cells or purified proteins in 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7, by adding FM to a final concentration of 5 \\μM, at 37 \\°C for 15 min. Terminate the labeling reaction by adding \\β-mercaptoethanol to 140 \\μM, which instantaneously reacts with excess fluorophore maleimide.\n6. Post-labeling processing and storage: After collecting the fluoresceinated cells by centrifugation at 7,500 \\times g for 15 min, wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspend the labeled bacteria in PBS. Immediately use the labeled cells in spectroscopic experiments or rest them on ice (up to 24 h), or add glycerol to 15% and store them (indefinitely) as 1-mL aliquots at -70 \\°C. In the latter case, after thawing the labeled cells, pellet them by centrifugation in a microfuge, wash them once, and resuspend them in PBS. For evaluation of protein expression or the extent of FM-labeling, solubilize aliquots of the cell suspensions with sample buffer, and subject them to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, first visualize the extent of labeling with a fluorescence imager (Typhoon 8600GE/Amersham), and then stain the gels with Coomassie blue R (Ames, 1974).\n7. Assess the efficacy of covalent modification by diluting aliquots of fluoresceinated cells or proteins in PBS in a fluorometer; analyze with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm. Calculate the specific fluorescence of the samples (fluorescence intensity/10\\^9 cells or /mg protein).\n8. Measure the extent of fluorescence quenching by natural ligands: Observe fluorophore-labeled cells in a fluorometer (e.g., OLIS-SLM AMINCO 8100 or OLIS Clarity). For binding determinations, deposit 2.5 \\times 10\\^7 labeled cells in a quartz cuvette (final volume: 2 mL) with stirring at 37 \\°C, measure the initial fluorescence (F0), and then add increasing concentrations of a ligand, while monitoring the quenching of fluorescence emissions (F) at 520 nm. Use, store on ice (up to 24 h), or preserve at -70 \\°C in 10% glycerol.\nNotes: 1. Host bacteria OM proteins from many Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, K. pneumoniae (Kumar et al., 2022), Acinetobacter baumannii (Nairn et al., 2017), Caulobacteri crescentus (Balhesteros et al., 2017) and more, are susceptible to FM labeling in situ, in the cell envelopes of those living cells. However, the cell surface of laboratory E. coli is a preferred environment for expression and labeling of both native and foreign OM proteins, because it is not obscured by an LPS O-antigen nor capsular polysaccharide. Hence, we perform most labeling reactions in laboratory E. coli host strains.   \n2. Protein expression It is advisable to adopt a cloning/expression strategy that maximizes production of the target OM protein. We use iron-regulated Fur promoters in conjunction with iron-deficient MOPS media, to maximize the expression of foreign proteins in E. coli. However, other promoters (e.g., lac or tac) are equally effective.   \n3. Media for bacterial growth and target protein expression As a result of the iron-regulated promoters in our experiments, we utilize MOPS minimal media, that is a complete minimal media for Enterobacteriaceae (Neidhardt et al., 1974), and readily rendered iron-deficient by excluding FeSO4 and tricine from its formulation. We have no experience with the chemical modification of cells grown in other defined media or broths, but we anticipate that regardless of growth media, preliminary washing with 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7, will lead to efficacious maleimide labeling reactions."

Grind the tissue until the sample is a fine powder. Carefully add more liquid N2 if needed to keep frozen.\n3. Weight 500 mg of tissue into a microfuge tube and add 900 µl of extraction buffer 1 (EB1) (for fruit tissue the ratio of powered tissue/EB is 1:1.8, w/v. This ratio may need to be increased to 1:3 for leaf tissue).\n4. Keep on ice while preparing all samples and vortex for 30 sec.\n5. Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C and 13,000 x g.

Briefly, a continuous assay is used in which OAA produced by PEPCK is immediately reduced to malate, and this is achieved by the inclusion of malate dehydrogenase. The oxidation of NADH by malate dehydrogenase is measured at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer.\n1. Accurately pipette 2-10 µl of clarified extract into a microplate well.\n2. Use a repeat pipettor to add 150 µl PEPCK assay mix 1 to each well and immediately place in microplate spectrophotometer. Continuously monitor NADH oxidation to NAD+ as a decline in absorbance at 340 nm (A340), taking readings every 5-10 sec for up to 5 min (the samples need to shake while reading).\n3. Correct for background NADH oxidation by omitting PEP from the reaction mixture. Ensure that the decline in A340 (amount of NADH being oxidized; ε340 = 6,220/M/cm) is proportional to assay time and concentration of enzyme assayed. Dilution of clarified extract in extraction buffer may be necessary for samples containing abundant PEPCK activity.\nNote: One international unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme resulting in the production of 1 µmol of product per min at 25 °C. PEPCK activity in (U/ml clarified extract) = (ΔA340/min x clarified extract dilution factor)/6.22. Thus, if 3.0 μl of clarified extract mixed with 150 μl of PEPCK reaction mixture yields a ΔA340/min of 0.2 at 340 nm, then the PEPCK activity = (0.2 x 50)/6.22 U/ml = 1.6 U/ml.\n\nExtraction for measuring NADP-ME activity:\n1. Collect the sample and freeze immediately in liquid N2. Store at -80 °C until use.\n2. Add small amount of liquid N2 and frozen sample into a mortar. Grind the tissue until the sample is a fine powder. Carefully add more liquid N2 if needed to keep frozen.\n3. Weight 100 mg of tissue into a microfuge tube and add 200 µl of extraction buffer 4 (EB4) (for fruit tissue the ratio of powered tissue/EB is 1:2, w/v. This ratio may need to be increased to 1:3 for leaf tissue).\n4. Keep on ice while preparing all samples and vortex for 30 sec.\n5. Centrifuge 10 min at 4 °C and 13,000 x g. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube. Measure NADP-ME activity immediately or the aliquots of clarified extracts can be snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C for future use.\n\nNADP-ME activity measurement:\nThe activity of NADP-ME is based upon the reduction of NADP+ at 340 nm at 25 °C. Briefly, a continuous assay is used in which malate is oxidized to pyruvate and CO2, and NADP+ is reduced to NADPH. The reduction of NADP+ by NADP-ME is measured at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer.\n1. Accurately pipette 5-10 µl of clarified extract into a microplate well.\n2. Use a repeat pipettor to add 100 µl NADP-ME assay mix 1 to each well and immediately place in microplate spectrophotometer. Continuously monitor NADP+ reduction to NADPH as an increase in absorbance at 340 nm (A340), taking readings every 5-10 sec for up to 5 min (the samples need to shake while reading).\n3. Correct for background NADP+ reduction by omitting L-malate from the reaction mixture. Ensure that the increase in A340 is proportional to assay time and concentration of enzyme assayed. Dilution of clarified extract in extraction buffer may be necessary for samples containing abundant NADP-ME activity.\nNote: One international unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 µmol of NADPH min-1 under the specified conditions. NADP-ME activity in (U/ml clarified extract) = (ΔA340/min x clarified extract dilution factor)/6.22. Thus, if 2.0 μl of clarified extract mixed with 100 μl of NADP-ME reaction mixture yields a ΔA340/min of 1.5 at 340 nm, then the NADP-ME activity = (1.5 x 50)/6.22 U/ml = 12.5 U/ml.\n\nBradford assay of protein concentration:\n1. For preparing the BSA standard curve: Make 1 ml stock solution of 10 mg BSA/200 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and prepare a duplicate standard curve, using the template below:\n   Final concentration (ng/l) | Vol. (µl) BSA stock (0.05 mg/ml) | PBS (µl) | µg protein/well\n   --------------------------|----------------------------------|----------|----------------\n   0                         | 0                                | 200      | 0\n   6.25                      | 25                               | 175      | 1.25\n   12.5                      | 50                               | 150      | 2.5\n   18.7                      | 75                               | 125      | 3.75\n   25.0                      | 100                              | 100      | 5\n\n2. Pipette 50 µl of aliquot supernatants (or its dilutions) or BSA standards to each well.\n3. Add 130 µl Bradford stock solution (see Materials and Reagents section) previously dissolved in distillate water (dilution 1/5).\n4. Shake briefly and wait 5 min. Determine the OD at 595 nm. Use slope and blank obtained from the calibration to determine the protein concentration in each extract.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: Cycloheximide Assays to Measure Protein Degradation in vivo in Plants\nBackground: The half-life of a protein is a characteristic property, and can be modulated by posttranslational modifications, changes in subcellular localization, and/or interaction with other proteins or ligands. As one determinant of its steady-state level, a protein’s degradation represents an important distinguishing attribute relevant to its biological function. Because protein longevity cannot be elucidated from bioinformatics analyses, it must be determined empirically. Here we describe two approaches for in vivo half-life determination in plants: 1. pooled-seedling degradation assays monitoring either tagged versions of the protein (luciferase fusions or other epitope tags) or following the endogenous protein; 2. single-seedling degradation assays using luciferase fusion proteins.

Pooled seedling cycloheximide in vivo degradation protocol\nThis protocol is called the pooled seedling degradation assay because populations of seedlings are grown in multiple Petri plates and the protein/activity measured from an extract of one plate of seedlings harvested at a specific time after addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) represents a single time point. An important aspect of this assay to emphasize is that degradation occurs in vivo and the amount of protein remaining at specific time points is determined after termination of degradation, protein extraction and detection. CHX is an effective protein synthesis inhibitor for intact seedlings (Ramos et al., 2001). The degradation rate and then subsequently the half-life of any protein can be measured and derived from data obtained in the pooled seedling CHX assay as long as there is the ability to detect the protein, either by enzyme assay or antibody detection. Multiple plates at each time point can be included in the analysis, and the same extract (time-point) sampled multiple times. Finally, the experiment should be repeated with independently grown seedlings.\n\nProcedure for pooled seedling assay, analyzed using LUC fusions: Make extracts, determine total protein content. Aliquot into microtiter wells, load plate into luminometer. For Western analysis, the initial procedure is the same, but extract is analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibody of choice rather than aliquoted into a microplate and analyzed in a luminometer.\n\n1. ~2 mg of Arabidopsis seeds (weighed out) are placed in a microfuge tube and surface-sterilized by a 10 min treatment with 300 μl of a fresh (less than 2 weeks old) solution of 30% commercial bleach + 0.1% Tween-20, followed by 2 sterile water rinses (typically, 800 μl each) to remove the bleach. The seeds are then suspended in 1 ml of liquid growth media (GM) and transferred to 60 x 15 mm sealed (Parafilm) Petri dishes with a pipet tip whose tip was cut to make the opening wider. Seeds are carefully disturbed around the edge of Petri dish. The seeds and liquid should not cover the entire bottom of the plate. This reduces the need for excess media. After plating, seeds are stratified by incubation at 4 °C for 2-3 days in the dark. Plates are then removed from the cold and incubated at 22 °C under constant light (~50-70 μmol sec-1 m-2) for 6 days without shaking. This amount of liquid is sufficient to last 6 days for this amount of seed. If growth is more robust, or more seeds are used, then media may need to be added to the plates before day 6 to keep the seedlings sufficiently hydrated. In a sterile hood, open the plate and add a small amount of sterile liquid GM media. Reseal the plate and return to 22 °C under constant light.\n2. On the evening of the 6th day, open the plates, remove any remaining liquid and replace the media with 900 μl fresh sterile GM. Reseal the plates with fresh Parafilm. This step, as well as the initiation of the degradation experiments, should be conducted at the same time of day to control for circadian effects on degradation.\n3. On the morning of the 7th day, add 100 μl of 2,000 μg/ml cycloheximide (CHX) stock (CHX powder is dissolved in liquid GM media. Stock should be less than 2 weeks old stored at 4 °C) to the plates of seedlings, and incubate under same conditions for at least three time periods: as examples - 15, 30, and 45 min (for very short-lived proteins) or 1, 2 and 4 h (for more stable proteins). To mix in the added CHX, rock the plate in your hand with a circular motion for 15 sec. Mix with hand again during the time-course. Intermediate times can also be used. The minus CHX controls (the mock samples) are represented by dishes of seedlings treated with addition of 100 μl GM alone for the maximum time. We recommend 3 plates (biological replicates) for the mock at each time-point in the experiment. In our hands, protein levels in control incubations were not different from samples harvested at the start of time course.\n4. After the appropriate time, remove seedlings from the plate, blot dry with a Kimwipe or a paper towel, and quick-freeze in liquid nitrogen. After all samples are obtained, they should be processed as quickly as possible.\n5. When ready to process the samples (in our hands, storage of tissue for LUC assays at -80 °C for more than a few days results in variable activity, and thus tissue should be processed soon after collection), grind the seedlings in ~200 µl luciferase extraction buffer, if quantifying the protein of interest by luciferase assay, or in ~200 µl protein extraction buffer, if quantifying protein by Western blot.\n6. Clear the samples by centrifugation at 15,000 x g in a refrigerated centrifuge (4 °C) for 20 min, and transfer the supernatant to a clean tube pre-chilled on ice. Quantify the protein concentration in each sample using a Bradford assay or equivalent method. Note: For the remainder of the protocol, follow the appropriate directions for either the luciferase assay or Western blot assay.\n\nLuciferase assay (continue from step 6):\n7. Transfer 10 µl of the extract for each sample into a well of a white, polystyrene flat-bottomed 96-well plate. Arrange the samples in the plate so that they can be measured in technical triplicates or at a minimum in duplicate.\n8. Program the luminometer to inject 100 µl of luciferase assay buffer into each well, followed by 40 µl of 0.5 mM luciferin (loaded into one of the injector reservoirs). Measure the luminescence (in relative light units, RLU) for 8 sec. Set up the program to inject the buffer, followed by luciferin, and immediately measure. Each luminometer has a procedure to set up for injection of a solution (in this case should be luciferin) and for length of time to collect light emission. Please read the instructions that comes with your particular make and model.\n9. Calculate the RLU/µg protein by using the data from the luminometer and the protein quantification assay for each sample.\n10. Average the RLU/µg protein for the mock samples, and use this to normalize the RLU/µg protein for the other time-points.\n11. Linearize the data by calculating the natural log (ln) of the normalized RLU/µg protein.\n12. Plot the natural log (ln) of the normalized RLU/µg protein versus time, with the averaged mock sample as the 0 time-point, and perform a linear regression to determine the slope of this line. We generally force the line through the origin. Divide ln (0.5) by the slope to determine the half-life. We recommend having 3 biological replicates for each time-point, and three technical replicates for each biological replicate. The linear regression represents all of these replicates combined for a single experiment. Sample data from a pooled seedling degradation assay using LUC fusions is available. Protocol as described was used to analyze 3 different transgenic lines. Two lines are expressing IAA1:LUC fusion in two different Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 genetic backgrounds; wild type (magenta line) and cul1-7 (blue line). Data were analyzed as described and regression lines indicated. The half-life of IAA1-LUC in the wild type line is 14 min, and in cul1-7 is ~70 min. A transgenic line expressing unfused luciferase shows no detectable degradation in this time period (yellow line). Adapted from data obtained in Gilkerson et al. (2007).\n\nWestern blot assay (perform steps 1-6 as above, then continue with the following):\n13. After protein quantification, load equal total protein for each time-point onto standard polyacrylamide gels for SDS-PAGE. The amount of total protein applied to the gel depends on the abundance of the protein, which has to be determined empirically. Proteins are transferred from the gel to a PVDF membrane for antibody visualization. The exact conditions for protein visualization using antibodies depend on the antibody and the expression of the protein. For example, there are multiple chemiluminescent detection kits with different sensitivities.\n14. When film is used, blots should be scanned using a flat-bed scanner without auto-toning and saved as 8-bit gray-scale tagged-image-file-format images. After scanning and capturing an image, perform spot densitometry using NIH ImageJ 1.36 without background correction to quantify the amount of protein at each time-point. For detailed instructions on use of ImageJ for spot densitometry, we recommend the website “Analyzing gels and Westerns with ImageJ” (http://lukemiller.org/index.php/2010/11/analyzing-gels-and-Western-blots-with-image-j/).\n15. Normalize the amount of protein at the various times to the amount without CHX. Calculate the natural log of that normalized value to linearize the data. The ln(normalized band intensity) should be plotted against time, and the slope of this line used to calculate the half-life by the following equation: t1/2 = [ln(0.5)]/slope. Data for all blots should be combined to draw a single line for the final half-life calculations. Linear regression analysis should be performed to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the slope of the line.\n16. This experiment should be repeated at least 3 times and each sample analyzed twice as technical replicates. An example of pooled seedling degradation assay using Western blot analysis is provided. The stability of native phytochrome A (PhyA) was assessed in 2 different genetic backgrounds, wild-type (CULLIN 1) and cul1-7, defective in a type of ubiquitin E3 ligase. Seeds were germinated in 1 ml liquid GM and dark-grown for four days (to allow PhyA accumulation). Cycloheximide was added (with the exception of the dark mock control), and seedlings exposed to 20 μmol/m-2 s-1 red light for the indicated times, then flash frozen. PhyA is degraded in the light. Protein extracts were made, and 40 μg total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE. A. PhyA levels at different times were determined by immunoblotting with an anti (α)-PhyA antibody. A cross reactive band was included as a loading control. B. Quantification of PhyA degradation in cul1-7. ImageQuant 1.0 software was used to quantify relative PhyA levels from the Western blot analyses described in (A). Values represent averages ± SD from a total of at least three Western blots from three independent experiments. T1/2 = 96 min in CUL1. PhyA is not degraded appreciably in cul1-7. This is Figure 7 from Gilkerson et al. (2009). Reprinted with permission from Genetics Society of America, which holds the copyright.\n\nB. Single seedling CHX in vivo degradation assays using luciferase (LUC) fusions\nThis protocol is called the single seedling degradation assay because degradation of a LUC fusion protein is measured separately in individual seedlings, and the individual degradation kinetics are pooled afterward to obtain a single half-life. In our laboratory, the only proteins that have been analyzed using this protocol have been proteins expressed as fusions with the reporter protein luciferase (typically from Firefly). Because the luciferase substrate is cell-permeable, luciferase activity can be detected in an intact seedling as light emission after incubation with luciferin, and this light emitted can be quantitated in a luminometer (Gilkerson et al., 2009). In plants, the half-life of unfused LUC was determined to be ~70 min when intact plants are provided the substrate luciferin and degradation measured in vivo (Gilkerson et al., 2009). Therefore, in these in vivo assays the half-life of a protein (peptide)-LUC fusion protein has to be shorter than 70 min or else the degradation rate determined will be driven primarily by the luciferase portion of the fusion protein. However, if degradation of the protein (peptide)-LUC fusion is more rapid than 70 min, then the degradation rate observed results from the degradation determinants present in the protein (peptide) co-expressed with LUC, not simply from LUC amino acids alone.\n\n1. Seeds from plants expressing LUC fusions are surface sterilized (step A1) and imbibed in water for 2 days at 4 °C in the dark. An individual seed is placed in one microtiter well of a white, polystyrene, flat-bottomed, 96-well plate containing 200 µl solid GM media. Plates are sealed with clear adhesive plate film and placed in continuous white light for 7-10 days at room temperature. A close-up view of a 96-well microtiter plate with one Arabidopsis seedling in each well is shown. In vivo LUC activity can be measured in a luminometer after addition of the substrate, luciferin.\n2. After incubation, 50 µl of 1 mM luciferin is added to each well and the plates are incubated with slow rocking in the dark (covered with foil) for 60 min at room temperature. Then 20 µl of a 2,000 µg/ml solution of CHX is added to each well and the plate immediately put in the luminometer for measurement. Light emission was monitored over a time-course, with measurements taken every 15 min.\n3. The luminometer measures (here suggest measuring for 8 sec at each time point) relative light units (RLU) emitted from individual seedlings and the data are stored in an Excel spreadsheet.\n4. Data analysis. The time interval between each recording is determined by the number of minutes at the start of the first measurement, designated time 0. The RLU (relative light units) at each time-point is normalized to the zero time-point measurement. To linearize the data, the ln(normalized RLU) is calculated for each individual seedling. Calculate the slope of degradation line for each seedling using the slope function in Excel. Use the following formula to calculate the half-life: half-life (min) = ln(0.5)/slope. Average the half-lives for all the seedlings and determine the descriptive statistics (standard deviation, standard error, 95% confidence). Sample data from single seedling degradation assay is provided. A. Frequency distribution for IAA7-LUC half-lives determined in 240 individuals by the single-seedling assay. B. Half-life of IAA7-LUC is 15.0 min, determined using single-seedling assay data shown in (A). Error bar is standard deviation.\nNotes: 1. If there is no prior knowledge of the degradation kinetics of the protein of interest, we recommend pilot experiments with one treatment time-point to determine whether the protein is rapidly degraded (with a half-life of less than 1 h) or more slowly, with a half life of > 1 h. For these pilot experiments, the protocol is the same except only 2 plates are needed, one with solvent only added-no cycloheximide (CHX) and one with added CHX. We recommend starting with a 2 h CHX treatment. If the protein is completely absent after 2 h (in the + CHX sample based on normal sample treatment and signal development time), then a short time course is required. If the protein abundance is only slightly reduced, then the longer time courses starting at and after 1 h, such as 1, 2 and 4 h of CHX treatment are required. If protein level is detected, but significantly reduced at 2 h (< 50%), then a time course in the range of 30 min, 1 and 2 h is appropriate. This single time point CHX assay can be repeated until the appropriate range of protein loss is observed.\n\n2. To measure protein half-life, once the appropriate times are determined, multiple time points are required. In addition, the protein must be reduced to < 50% of its control value in at least one of the time points. Extrapolation of lines to calculate a half-life is not appropriate, given that complex degradation kinetics can occur; therefore, protein half-life cannot be accurately measured from extrapolating the line past the last time point to reach 50% of initial value, or by using the decay equation to determine half-life if the values used to generate the line derive from protein that has not been significantly reduced in abundance in the time course.   \n3. We also recommend using a rapidly degraded protein as a control protein to monitor the efficacy of the CHX and to verify the procedure and time course. In each experiment, we routinely include a sample of transgenic line expressing a detectable form of Arabidopsis protein indole acetic\n\nacid 1 (IAA1) because this protein is very short-lived, with a half-life of \\~12-15 min (Ramos et al., 2001; Zenser et al., 2001). Lines expressing either 3xHA-IAA1 (Dreher et al., 2006) or an IAA1-LUC fusion (Zenser et al., 2001; Dreher et al., 2006) have been used. Significant loss of this protein in short time courses and undetectable amounts at longer times (< 1 h, again under specific conditions) are observed and can certify that the CHX treatment was effective in blocking new synthesis. Such transgenic lines are available from the corresponding author upon request.\n\n4. CHX assays also work with mature leaf disks floating on GM media using the same pooled seedling assay (a more accurate term in this case would be pooled leaf disc assay) using the same Petri dishes (but with a pre-incubation of 2-4 h after placing on GM). Leaf discs (or punches) are placed on GM media, allowed to incubate for 2-4 h in assay conditions before addition of CHX (or mock) as in step A3.\n\n5. Both of the experimental approaches described above take advantage of cycloheximide’s ability to enter cells of intact organs/seedlings and effectively inhibit protein synthesis, properties that have been known for a long time [For examples, see (Delseny et al.,1977; Sluiters-Scholtern, 1973)]. A word of caution. Treatment with cycloheximide for significant lengths of time may lead to secondary effects. If your protein has a modest degradation rate, in the order of hours based on these CHX assays, it is strongly recommended that a different approach confirm the half-life, given the possible secondary effects of prolonged incubation in a protein synthesis inhibitor. For example, degradation of a protein could depend on a short-lived protein that will become depleted during a long CHX chase assay. In this case, the protein will appear stable in CHX assays, while in vivo it could be short-lived. Degradation of the protein could be coupled to ongoing synthesis, which is blocked with CHX treatment. RNA synthesis is affected by CHX, and some genes are induced by cycloheximide (likely due to regulation by short-lived repressors) and while unlikely, these effects could modulate your protein’s longevity. Alternative approaches are pulse-chase experiments (with radiolabeled amino acids, but without CHX), 15N- and D2Olabeling experiments (Yang et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012). For an overview of the topic, see a recent review (Nelson and Millar, 2015)."

    "text": "Experiment Name: Mouse Mammary Intraductal (MIND) Method for Transplantation of Patient Derived Primary DCIS Cells and Cell Lines\nBackground: The MIND method involves intraductal injection of patient derived ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cells and DCIS cell lines (MCF10DCIS.COM and SUM225) inside the mouse mammary ducts [Video 1 and Figure 1 in Behbod et al. (2009)]. This method mimics the normal environment of DCIS and facilitates study of the natural progression of human DCIS, i.e., their initial growth as carcinoma in situ within the ducts, followed by invasion into the stroma through the myoepithelial cell layer and basement membrane (Behbod et al., 2009; Valdez et al., 2011). In order to demonstrate that transplantation procedure is successful, the transplanted mammary glands may be excised as early as two weeks following intraductal injection of cells followed by Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining and/or immunofluorescence staining using human specific cytokeratin 5 and/or 19 [please see Figures 2-4 in Behbod et al. (2009)]. Additionally, the presence of trypan blue inside the mouse mammary ducts immediately following intraductal injection is the best indicator that the injection was successful (Video 1 starting at 4:33 sec).\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. Hamilton syringe, 50 μl capacity, with a 30 gauge blunt-ended fixed 1/2-inch needle (Hamilton, catalog number: 80608)\n2. 1 ml Tuberculin (TB) syringe (Benton Dickenson, catalog number: 309625)\n3. Wound clips (Becton Dickinson, catalog number: 427631)\n4. Animals: 8-12 week old female immunocompromised mice\n5.

KetofenTM (Ketoprofen) (Patterson Veterinary Supply, catalog number: 10004029)\nEquipments: 1. Scissors Small scale suitable for mice Sharp-Blunt (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 14028-10) Castroviejo Spring Scissors (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 15017-10) Balled Scissors (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 14086-09)\n2. Clippers (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 1501710)\n3. Rounded end flat handle tweezers (ROBOZ, model: RS5095)\n4. Spring scissor (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 1501710)\n5. Balled scissor (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 1408609)\n6. Rounded end tweezers (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 1105210)\n7. Rat tooth tweezers (Fine Science Tool, catalog number: 1105310)\n8. Clip applier (Becton Dickinson, catalog number: 427630)\n9. Heat pad (Sunbeam Products, model: PN126985900)\n10. Clip remover (Becton Dickinson, catalog number: 427638)\nProcedures: A. Prepare the cells for injection\n1. Resuspend cells in PBS with 0.04% trypan blue. For cell lines, the final concentration should be 5,000-10,000 cells/μl. For primary cells the concentration should be 12,500-17,500 cells/μl. Trypan blue will indicate the presence of cells inside the duct after the injection procedure.\n2. Be sure all instruments have been sterilized and the Hamilton syringe washed by alternating pulling up sterile water and 70% alcohol, ending with sterile water.\n\nB. Prepare the mice for surgery\n1. Weigh the mouse.\n2. Using 1 ml TB syringe, administer Nembutal 40 μg/g body intraperitoneal (this will provide 1 h of sedation).\n3. Wait for mouse to fall asleep; confirm by checking hind limb reflex by pinching foot.\n4. Use clippers to shave the abdomen exposing the inguinal nipples and taking care not to cut them.\n5. Using 1 ml TB syringe, administer KetofenTM (ketoprofen) 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal for pain relief.\n6. Place the mouse on surgical board and secure limbs with surgical tape.\n7. Sterilize the abdomen with 70% alcohol.\n\nC. Surgery\n1. Cut off the tip of the nipples of the inguinal glands so that the syringe can be directly inserted through the nipple. Use the rounded end flat handle tweezers to hold the skin under the nipple and force it to protrude. Use the spring scissor to cut off about the top 0.5 mm of the nipple. Take care not to remove too much or the syringe will slide under the skin. A properly cut nipple will have a volcano cone shape.\n2. Using the balled scissors, make an inverted Y-incision on the abdomen beginning on the midline slightly below the inguinal nipple and extending up about 1 inch. The other two cuts of the incision should extend between and fourth and fifth nipples on either side.\n3. Using the rounded end tweezers and rat tooth tweezers, separate the skin covering the inguinal mammary fat pads to expose the inguinal gland.\n4. Using the Hamilton syringe, draw up two microliters of PBS (with 0.04% trypan blue) containing cells at the proper concentration; holding the skin flap up, insert the tip of the syringe into the nipple at a 90 degree angle to the skin flap and carefully inject the cells. Trypan blue will make the injected liquid visible in the duct.\n5. Reposition the skin flaps and suture with wound clips.\n\nD. Post-surgery\n1. Allow mice to recover on heat pad set on the lowest setting.\n2. Administer KetofenTM 5 mg/kg intraperitoneal 24 h later.\n3. Remove clips after 7-10 days.\nNotes: None"

    "text": "Experiment Name: Intracellular Assessment of ATP Levels in Caenorhabditis elegans\nBackground: Eukaryotic cells heavily depend on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generated by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) within mitochondria. ATP is the major energy currency molecule, which fuels cell to carry out numerous processes, including growth, differentiation, transportation and cell death among others (Khakh and Burnstock, 2009). Therefore, ATP levels can serve as a metabolic gauge for cellular homeostasis and survival (Artal-Sanz and Tavernarakis, 2009; Gomes et al., 2011; Palikaras et al., 2015). In this protocol, we describe a method for the determination of intracellular ATP levels using a bioluminescence approach in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.\nMaterials & Reagents: 1. 1.5 ml tube\n2.

Scale bar = 1 mm. C. During development worms increase in size throughout four larval stages (L1, L2, L3 and L4). L4 hermaphrodite nematodes can be distinguished by the developing vulva (red arrowhead), which is a clear half circle in the center of the ventral side. Scale bar = 0.5 mm.\n\nB. Preparation of nematodes samples\n1. Use an eyebrow/eyelash hair and collect 50-100 adult animals in 50 μl of M9 buffer in a 1.5 ml tube (see Note 1).\n2. Use the same number of animals of each strain during sample preparation.\n3. Freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen.\n4. Store the samples at -80 °C until further analysis.\n5. Immerse frozen worms in boiling water for 15 min.\n6. Place the samples on ice for 5 min.\n7. Spin down samples at 14,800 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\n8. Transfer sample supernatants into new 1.5 ml tubes.\n9. Dilute sample supernatants tenfold by adding water before measurement.\n10. Keep the samples on ice or store them at -20 °C.\n\nC.

ATP standard solutions are stable for at least one week.\nc. Dilute ATP standards by serial dilutions in the range of 10 to 1 x 10-4 µM. Prepare serial dilutions of one ATP standard solution using distilled water to generate the ATP standard curve.\n2. Luciferase reagent\na. Dissolve lyophilized luciferase by adding 10 ml of distilled water.\nb. Incubate dissolved luciferase for 5 min at 4 °C.\nc. Gently swirl the bottle and mix for a homogeneous solution. Avoid shaking.\nd. Store luciferase reagent at -20 °C (see Note 3).\n\nD. Determination of ATP levels\n1. Add 100 μl of each sample or ATP standard in a 1.5 ml tube. Use a sample containing M9 buffer as blank (no ATP). For each sample or ATP standard, use at least 3 replicates.\n2. Add 100 μl luciferase reagent to the sample/standard (see Note 4).\n3. Incubate for 10 sec at room temperature.\n4. Measure and record ATP levels of the sample/standard by using TD-20/20 luminometer.\n5. Prepare and measure the next sample/standard. Repeat steps D1-D4.\n6. Transfer supernatants (solubilized proteins; obtained during step B8) of each sample into new 1.5 ml tubes and measure protein concentration using a standard protein kit, such as PierceTM BCA Protein Assay Kit, following the instructions of the manufacturer (Figure 2A).\n7. Open and review the recorded data (obtained during steps D4 and D6) in Microsoft Office 2011 Excel.\n8. Subtract the value of the ATP blank sample from the raw data.\n9. Prepare ATP standard curve by using the concentrations of ATP standards and their respective bioluminescence values.\n10. Calculate the ATP content of each sample by using a log-log plot of the ATP standard curve data (Figure 2B).\n11. Divided the ATP levels (obtained during step D10) with the total protein amount (nM/mg; obtained in step D6) in Microsoft Office 2011 Excel software.\n12.

ATP dilutions were assayed with luciferase reagent in TD-20/20 luminometer. C. ATP levels are decreased in PINK-1 depleted nematodes (***P < 0.001; unpaired t-test). Error bars denote SEM.\nNotes: 1. Take a toothpick and glue an eyebrow/eyelash hair to the tip of it. Let it dry at room temperature. Then, use this tool to pick nematodes. Before using the eyebrow/eyelash hair always sterilize it by using 70% of EtOH.   \n2. Each bottle of lyophilized ATP contains approximately 10 mg (> 98% purity; Mr: 605.2; ATP bioluminescence assay kit CLS II).   \n3. Each freeze/thaw cycle reduces luciferase activity. Therefore, a. Avoid repeated freezing and thawing; b. Prepare aliquots of luciferase (1 ml); c. Set up a new ATP standard curve after each freeze/thaw cycle.   \n4. Luciferase activity is influenced by extreme pH values. The optimal pH value for the luciferase reaction is between 7.6-8.0."
