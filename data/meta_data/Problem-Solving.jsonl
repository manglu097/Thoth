{"exp_name": "Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy for Arabidopsis Epidermal, Mesophyll and Vascular Parenchyma Cells", "abstract": "Investigation of protein targeting to plastids in plants by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) can be complicated by numerous sources of artifact, ranging from misinterpretations from in vivo protein over-expression, false fluorescence in cells under stress, and organellar mis-identification. Our studies have focused on the plant-specific gene MSH1, which encodes a dual targeting protein that is regulated in its expression and resides within the nucleoid of a specialized plastid type (Virdi et al., 2016). Therefore, our methods have been optimized to study protein dual targeting to mitochondria and plastids, spatial and temporal regulation of protein expression, and sub-organellar localization, producing a protocol and set of experimental standards that others may find useful for such studies.", "materials": "1. 5 ml tube\n2.

Infiltrate young leaves of about 4 weeks old tobacco plants, Nicotiana tabacum cv. xanthi using a needleless syringe.\n5. Visualize plant expression after 48 h.\n\nB. Preparation of Arabidopsis plant samples\n1. Leaf/flower preparation:\na. The surface tension of the water used for wet mounting under a larger cover slip will hold samples steady during imaging.\nb. The addition of a trace of Tween 20 (5-10 µl in 250 ml water) will assist in the wetting of flowers, which are far more hydrophobic than leaves.\n2. Stem preparation:\na. A double-edged razor blade snapped in half longitudinally before unwrapping is used to make cross sections of stems. (Method for snapping blades: Grasp the blade so that the sharp edges are not pressured by the fingers. The index fingers are retracted while slow and constant pressure is used to bend the blade in half. As the two outer edges come closer, the index fingers and thumbs are placed near the folded side and pressure there will cause the blade to snap into two separate blades. Unwrapping the blade is done carefully again to prevent cuts through the paper. Each half of the blade may be used for dissection.)\nb. The stem sections should be taken in the middle of the internodes to avoid leaf vascular traces found near the nodes.\nc. The sections should be thin enough and consistent enough to fit under a coverslip (< 0.3 mm) while in water.\nd. Cut the stem in a forward and downward motion exposing the tissue to clean blade areas preventing further damage.\ne. The blade will dull within roughly 30 cross sections and should be rotated or disposed of. Dull blades will compress the stems and pull the helical thickenings of the secondary cell wall out of the metaxylem.\nf. (Method for cutting and mounting stem cross sections: The stem with the unneeded portions removed is laid flat on the slide with water. Sections are cut as thin as possible in a forward and downward motion. The blade may be rotated to expose a sharp edge, or the other half may be used. While cutting, the sections may stack; this is remedied by gentle manipulation with a dissecting needle or probe or insect pin. Once all sections are separated, a cover slip is placed on the samples. Uniform sections are important for level cover slip placement. Water may be added or wicked off to keep the sections in water, but without movement.)\n\nC. Preparation of enzymatically digested plant tissues\n1. Cut the leaves so most of the lamina is trimmed off from the midrib and veins and subject them to enzyme digestion. A six to seven weeks old plant is normally used for this experiment.\n2. Place the plant material to be digested in a Petri dish containing the enzyme solution and put it in a vacuum desiccator and vacuum infiltrate for 15 min. A 5-10 ml cellulase/macerozyme solution (see Recipes in Materials) is enough for a flowering A. thaliana plant.\n3. Take out the Petri dish from vacuum and continue digestion at RT for 2 h with gentle shaking on a platform shaker, between 30-50 RPM.\n4. The proper digestion time is near when the epidermis is digested away, and mesophyll cells begin sloughing away. The slurry generated to visualize vascular parenchyma with intact leaf or is easily transferred with a transfer pipette or fine tip forceps as the samples are not allowed to fully digest to the protoplast stage.\n5. Transfer the sample to a Petri dish containing 10 ml of the WI buffer. On a compound microscope, if the vasculature can be seen, the sample is ready for confocal analysis. Vasculature is easily identified by the helical thickenings in the xylem with transmitted light at 10x or 20x.\n6. Mount samples on slides with coverslips for confocal microscopy. The incubation solution is used to mount the sample, as it will support the cells during imaging.", "notes": "None"}

DAY ONE – Fix and block\nNote: The days noted are for the standard procedure. Step lengths can be modified (see below) and will alter the days in which a particular step is performed.\n1. Anesthetize your fish (using tricaine methanesulfonate, fish will be anesthetized in less than a minute), then sort into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (less than 100 fish per tube).\n2. Make a 2% TCA solution fresh from frozen aliquots.\n3. Using a Pasteur pipette, remove any excess fish water from the microcentrifuge tubes.\n4. Add 1 mL of 2% TCA to your larvae and rock for 3-4 h at room temperature (RT). Ensure the liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube.\n5. Wash in 1 mL of PBS for 5 × 5 min.\n6. Block using 1 mL of Western Block overnight at 4°C on a benchtop tube rocker.\n\nB. DAY TWO – Primary antibody stain\n(Option A) – Dissect, then stain\nNote: An alternative dissection method is at the end of the protocol, see F.\n1. Place embryos in a Sylgard plate with 1× PBS.\n2. Prepare new microcentrifuge tubes with Western Block. Dissected larvae will be placed into these tubes.\n3. Use pins to hold larvae during dissection.\n4. Remove eye and skin with tungsten wire and forceps.\n5. Use wire to cut off cerebellum, optic tectum, and telencephon. This decreases the thickness of the brain by approximately half when mounting.\n6. Place the dissected brain into microcentrifuge with Western Block.\n7. Block for 3 h at RT.\n8. Remove Western Block.\n9. Sonicate and vortex primary antibodies (at least twice).\n10. Add primary antibody mix (primary antibodies in Western Block). Rock overnight at 4°C. Ensure liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube.\n\n(Option B) – Whole larvae stain\n1. Remove Western Block.\n2. Sonicate/mix primary antibodies (at least twice).\n3. Add primary antibody mix (500 μL to 1 mL of primary antibodies in Western Block). Rock overnight at 4°C. Ensure liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube (Alternatively, you can rock overnight at RT).\n\nNote: The above protocols give the best results. Alternatively, steps can be truncated. Rather than blocking overnight, the block can be added for one hour, and then the fish transferred to the primary antibody to rock overnight. Instead of incubating with primary antibody overnight at 4°C, this can be done at RT for 5 h up to overnight.\n\nC. DAY THREE – Wash and add the fluorescent secondary antibody\n1. Remove primary antibody. Save the antibodies as they can be re-used many times. Staining becomes better with several uses (three to five times), as the antibodies are pre-absorbed. Over many uses, the staining will degrade (ten times). Store at 4°C. We advise adding sodium azide, as it is key to preserving the antibody long-term.\n2. Wash with PBSTx at least 5 × 15 min, but preferably all afternoon, with five changes of 1 mL of PBSTx.\n3. Remove PBSTx. (Alternatively, you can block/rock for 1 h at RT, then proceed.)\n4. Sonicate/mix secondary antibodies (at least twice).\n5. Add secondary antibody mix (500 μL to 1 mL of secondary antibodies in Western Block).\n6. Rock overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Ensure liquid and fish are moving inside the microcentrifuge tube. Note: The secondary antibody can be added for 3 h up to overnight. Note that all steps that shorten antibody incubations tend to decrease image quality, while those that increase the length or temperature tend to decrease the life of the antibodies.\n\nD. DAY FOUR – Wash\n1. Remove secondary antibody. (Save as noted above for primary antibodies.)\n2. Wash with 1 mL of PBSTx at least 4 × 15 min.\n3. Final change into new PBSTx, wash overnight at 4°C in the dark. (Alternatively, you can skip this final wash and move to the mounting stage.)\n\nE. DAY FIVE – Mount for imaging\n1. (Option A) – Mount using bridge\n    a. Remove PBSTx and replace with 1 mL of fresh PBSTx.\n    b. Create ‘bridge’ slide for mounting. Add one coverslip glued on either side of a slide using crazy glue. This becomes a bridge for your sample, so that you do not crush it. (Figure 1 in original protocol showed mounting the brain on a bridge slide.)\n    c. Move brains into Prolong Gold antifade and mount the brain ventral side up. Place a coverslip on top of the bridge. Ensure there is enough Prolong Gold antifade to cover the sample and watch out for air bubbles.\n    d. Seal edges with nail polish.\n    e. Image.\n\n2. (Option B) – Mount using vacuum grease pillars on coverslip\n    a. Dehydrate through 1 mL of 25%, 50%, and 75% glycerol in PBS (do not use PBSTx, as it creates bubbles with glycerol). After the addition of the next higher concentration of glycerol solution, wait for the embryos to ‘fall’ to the bottom of the tube before moving to the next dilution.\n    b. Dissect animals if necessary. See alternative dissection protocol below (F).\n    c. Mount the brains, using the minimal amount of vacuum grease to form pillars on the coverslip so that the tissue is not distorted. (Figure 2 in original protocol showed mounting brains using grease pillars.)\n        i. Mount brains with the ventral side to the coverslip. You can mount multiple brains if you are careful.\n        ii. Remove excess glycerol if present (use Kimwipe).\n        iii. Use vacuum grease to make pillars on each corner of the coverslip.\n        iv. Carefully place a slide onto the prepared coverslip. Gently push down on the slide, until the vacuum grease compresses and the brains barely touch the slide. The brains should be very carefully sandwiched between coverslip and slide, just touching each one.\n        v. Turn slide/coverslip over.\n        vi. Touch a small drop of Prolong Gold antifade to the edge of coverslip – it will ‘wick’ into the coverslip to surround the brains. Before applying, gently squeeze the tube and check to ensure you are not adding bubbles. Allow 3-4 h or overnight to set.\n    d. Seal edges with nail polish.\n    e. Image.\n\nF. Additional zebrafish brain/spine dissection method after TCA fixation and immunostaining\n1. Insert forceps just above the notochord, near the posterior end of the fish laying on its side. Separate forceps, to split the fish into two halves.\n2. Using these separated dorsal and ventral (D/V) larval halves, grab the end of each half with forceps, and pull the fish in two – the break should follow just dorsal to the notochord. The best imaging occurs when the notochord goes with the ventral half.\n3. Pull gently, but persistently – sometimes forceps must be repositioned. The otolith is often challenging for the D/V separation – ideally, the otolith will separate with the ventral half. If not, dissect it off. Ideally, the brain will separate from the eyes anteriorly. If not, dissect them off.\n4. The ventral half can be discarded (jaws, yolk, etc.).\n5. The dorsal half contains the brain/spine, with a clear view from the ventral side into the brain. Mount this dorsal half with its ventral portion facing the cover glass imaging surface.", "notes": "None"}

Ovalbumin (100 μg/mouse)\nAll reagents are diluted in sterile 1x DPBS (to a final total volume of 200 μl/mouse) and the final solution is inoculated by intravenous (i.v.) retro-orbital injection in the eye of each mouse. As control for immunization, some mice receive retro-orbital i.v. injections of sterile 1x DPBS: these naive/non-immunized mice are used to calculate the % of specific lysis, as compared to immunized mice.

Injection of splenocytes pulsed with the peptide and labeled with a high concentration of CFSE + splenocytes not pulsed with the peptide but labeled with a low concentration of CFSE\n1. Isolate the spleen of naive non-injected mice (1 naive non-injected mouse for every 3 OVA-immunized or DPBS-injected mice + control mouse) and place each spleen in a well (6-well plate).\n2. Mechanically disrupt the spleen to obtain single-cell suspensions in a small volume of DPBS (1-2 ml), and then wash cells with DPBS and centrifuge (652 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C).\n3. Resuspend the pellet and treat with ACK lysing buffer to lyse red blood cells: Add 2 ml of ACK per spleen and incubate for 2 min (at room temperature, RT).\n4. Wash each spleen suspension with 2-3 ml of RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin and filter them on cell strainers (40 μm). Pool the suspensions all together in one Falcon 50 tube (or more if many spleens are used for the experiments), add RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin until you reach 50 ml and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C).\n5. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in RPMI + Penicillin/Streptomycin; divide splenocytes into two halves. Add the peptide to one half (peptide SIINFEKL 10 μg/ml in the final volume of 2 ml per half spleen). For example: If 10 spleens are used for the experiment, 10 half-spleens will be pulsed with SIINFEKL (meaning 10 x 2 ml = 20 ml final volume) while the other half (equal volume as the final volume of spleen+ SIINFEKL; in our example: 20 ml) will remain without peptide.\n6. Incubate both suspensions for 30 min at 37 °C in a water bath. Gently mix every 10 min.\n7. Wash in RT DPBS 1x and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, + 4 °C) twice.\n8. In the meantime, prepare two solutions of CFSE (dilutions in 1x DPBS) in the dark:\na. CFSEhigh solution: 2.5 μM (diluted from the stock solution kept at -20 °C)\nb. CFSElow solution: 0.25 μM (dilution 1/10 from the CFSEhigh solution)\n9. Discard the supernatants and resuspend each pellet in 1 ml of DPBS and count the cells.\n10. Then, add the necessary volume of the CFSE solutions to their respective cell suspension to obtain a final concentration of 107 cells/ml as follows:\na. CFSEhigh solution to the splenocytes pulsed with peptide (2.5 μM of CSFE)\nb. CFSElow solution to the splenocytes without peptide (0.25 μM of CSFE)\nIncubate 15 min at RT in the dark.\n11. Wash each suspension with 40 ml of RPMI + 10% of FCS and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).\n12.

Splenocytes pulsed with peptide (and CFSEhigh)\nb. Splenocytes without peptide (and CFSElow)\nResuspend each suspension in DPBS to obtain a final concentration of 5 x 106/100 μl.\n\n14. Pool suspensions (both CFSEhigh andlow) together (ratio 1:1) and inject i.v. 200 μl of the mix to OVA-immunized and DPBS-injected mice. Do not forget to inject a naive (previously non-injected, non-immunized) mouse as control.\n\n15. Wait 20-24 h.\n\nC. Day 8\n1. Kill recipient mice, remove their spleen and put it on a cell strainer (40 μm) on a Falcon 50 tube. Mechanically disrupt the spleens (individually) to obtain single-cell suspensions, treat splenocytes with ACK buffer (2 ml/spleen) as described in steps B1-3.\n2. Wash with DPBS 1x and centrifuge (625 x g, 5 min, RT).\n3. Resuspend pellets in 1 ml of FACS buffer.\n4. Count cells and resuspend them to get 5 x 107 cell/ml.\n5. Filter using a 40 μm cell strainer (to avoid FACS blocking).\n6. FACS acquisition: On the Forward Scatter (FSC) vs. Side scatter (SSC) plot, gate cells on total splenocytes, then when plotting CFSE (in the FL-1, GFP or FITC channel) vs. SSC, gate on total CFSE+ cells. Within this gate, using another CFSE vs. SSC plot, distinguish between the CFSEhigh and CFSElow populations. Acquire 10,000 total CFSE+ events (i.e. of both populations: CFSEhigh and low). The number of total CFSE+ events should be the same for all the samples analyzed in order to better compare between OVA-immunized and non-immunized mice. In case 10,000 events cannot be reached, 5,000 events can be acquired, as long as the final number is the same for all samples.\n\nD. Data analysis\n1. For the analysis of the FACS data after acquisition, 2 populations (the CFSEhigh and the CFSElow) are distinguished by using the following gating strategy: Define the splenocyte gate on FSC and SSC, then after excluding the doublets, gate on the total CFSE+ cells. Within the CFSE+ cells, gate on the CFSEhigh and the CFSElow and determine (i) the percentage of CFSEhigh within total CFSE+ cells and (ii) the percentage of CFSElow within total CFSE+ cells.\n2. To calculate the percentage of specific lysis, use the following equation for each mouse (OVA or DPBS) or sample, compared to one control “naive” un-injected mouse: % specific lysis = 100 - [100 x (% CFSEhigh immunized mouse/% CFSElow immunized mouse)/(% CFSEhigh naive mouse/% CFSElow naive mouse).\n\nFigure 1. Representative dot plot of the FACS analysis of an in vivo killing assay.\nThe dot plots in Figure 1 represent the CFSE staining (vs. side scatter, SSC) in a non-immunized control mouse (A), a non-immunized naive mouse (B) and an OVA-immunized mouse (C) after gating on total splenocytes and then on total CFSE+ cells, as detailed in steps C21 and D22. The CFSEhigh and CFSElow gates are indicated for each mouse, and the respective percentages are shown in pink above each gate. The CFSEhigh population represents target cells pulsed with the SIINFEKL peptide, while CFSElow populations represent target cells not pulsed with any peptide.\n\nC57BL/6 mice are immunized with the OVA protein (or with DPBS; non-immunized mice) and 7 days later, they receive a mix of spleen cells from C57BL/6 mice, pulsed with the SIINFEKL peptide and stained with a high concentration of CFSE and cells not pulsed with the peptide, stained with a low concentration of CFSE, at a 1:1 ration. One day later, the spleen cells from recipient mice are isolated and analyzed by FACS to determine the % of CFSEhigh and CFSElow cells in each mouse (OVA-immunized mouse in Figure 1C and non-immunized mice in Figure 1B).\n\nOne naive non-injected mouse is used as the “control naive mouse” (Figure 1A) in the formula detailed above (this mouse is mentioned in step B14). All OVA-immunized (ex: Figure 1C) but also the naive DPBS-injected mice (a.k.a. non-immunized mice, ex: Figure 1B) will be compared to this control mouse in order to quantify and compare the specific lysis of non-immunized mice and OVA-immunized mice.\nIn this example, using the formula detailed above, the % of specific lysis for the non-immunized mouse in B is calculated as follows:\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x (42.6/57.1)/(45/54.6)]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.746/0.824]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.905]\n% specific lysis = 100 - 90.5\n% specific lysis = 9.5\nThe % of specific lysis for the OVA-immunized mouse in C is calculated as follows: % specific lysis = 100 - [100 x (3.2/96.5)/(45/54.6)]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.033/0.824]\n% specific lysis = 100 - [100 x 0.040]\n% specific lysis = 100 - 4.0\n% specific lysis = 96\nAs shown in the example, the % of specific lysis of each mouse is calculated as compared to the naive non-injected mouse set at control mouse.", "notes": "This protocol was optimized for the vaccination with the Ova protein and for the IVK test with the corresponding H-2b restricted OVA peptide that activates the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. The protocol can be adapted to other vaccine candidates and their corresponding peptide with a CD8+ T cell epitope. The respective concentrations should be optimized."}

In a separate black bottom plate, the biosensors were hydrated in 200 μl PBS for 10 min at room temperature prior to the experiment. The sample plate was generated according to a template. The buffer wells were filled with 200 μl PBS. Selected monoclonal antibodies were diluted to 5 μg/ml in PBS and dispensed at a volume of 200 μl into each well of the loading column as indicated in the template. The H1 well was filled with 200 μl PBS.

The sensors were dipped in buffer for equilibration.\n2. The sensors were transferred to the sensor plate and monoclonal antibodies were captured on the sensors at 1,000 rpm for 60 sec.\n3. Sensors were washed in PBS and a stable baseline was achieved at 1,000 rpm for 60 sec.\n4.

{"exp_name": "Staining of Membrane Receptors with Fluorescently-labeled DNA Aptamers for Super-resolution Imaging", "abstract": "One of the most prominent applications of fluorescent super-resolution microscopy is the study of nanodomain arrangements of receptors and the endocytic pathway. Staining methods are becoming crucial for answering questions on the nanoscale, therefore, the use of small and monovalent affinity probes is of great interest in super-resolution microscopy with biological samples. One kind of affinity probe is the aptamer. Aptamers are single DNA or RNA sequences that bind with high affinity to their targets and due to their small size they are able to (i) place the fluorophore in close proximity to the protein of interest and (ii) bind to most of the protein of interest overcoming the steric hindrance effect, resulting in better staining density. Here we describe a detailed protocol with which to stain live cells using aptamers and to image them with Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy. In this protocol, the stainings were performed with commercially available aptamers that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 or ErbB2) and the ephrin type-A receptor 2 (Epha2). Since aptamers can be coupled to most of the popular fluorophores, we believe that the procedure presented here can be extended to the large majority of the current super-resolution microscopy techniques.", "materials": "1.

Coupling of dye to aptamers\nDuring this step a thiol-maleimide cross-linking reaction is performed to conjugate the fluorophore to aptamers. Alternatively, aptamers with a 3’-amino group can be used for further conjugation with NHS esters (e.g., Atto647N NHS-ester). Some fluorescently labeled aptamers are also commercially available.\n1. Add 10 nmoles of the thiolated aptamer with 10 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine solution (TCEP; see Recipe 1) in 100 µl of 0.1 M TEAA. Heat the tube at 70 °C for 3 min and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 1 h.\n2. Desalt this reaction by size exclusion chromatography on a Biospin 6 column according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n3. Add to the reduced aptamer (from step A2) 4 µl of 10 µg/µl maleimide-functionalized Atto647N (previously dissolved in DMSO) and mix the contents well by pipetting or vortexing.\n4. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\n5. Recover the fluorophore-labelled aptamer by ethanol precipitation: add 100 µl of 300 mM NaCl and 450 µl cold ethanol, mix carefully by inverting the closed sample several times and freeze the sample in dry ice for 20 min (or at -20 °C for several hours), centrifuge at 15,000 x g (rcf) at 4 °C for 30 min, discard the supernatant and wash the pellet in 50 µl of 70% ethanol.\n6. Resuspend in 50 µl 1x DPBS and desalt on a Biospin 6 column into 1x DPBS.\n7. Measure the absorbance ratio at 260 nm and 650 nm.\n8. Confirm the labeling efficiency and absence of free dye by reversed phase HLPC (e.g., on a Nucleosil 100-5 C18 4 x 250 mm column using a gradient of 0-40% acetonitrile in TEAA buffer in 30 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 30 °C) or by anion exchange HPLC (e.g., Dionex DNAPac PA200 4 x 250 mm column using a gradient of 0-75% buffer B (see Recipe 12) in buffer A (see Recipe 11) in 40 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 60 °C.\n9. Store the labeled aptamer sample at -20 °C until use.\n\nB. Cell culture preparation prior to staining\nCell lines containing the receptor of interest (and cell lines lacking it, used as negative controls) should be seeded into 12-well plates containing coated coverslips with poly-L-lysine (PLL) one day before the aptamer staining. Depending on the cell line, choose adequate cell numbers (use the hemocytometer to count the cells) to reach approximately 70-80% confluence after 12-16 h incubation. The entire procedure described below must be performed under sterile conditions under a cell culture hood.\n1. HeLa (Epha2a positive) cells are grown in plates with complete DMEM medium (see Recipe 2) and A-431 (EGFR positive) and SKBR3 (ErbB2R positive) cells are cultured in complete RPMI medium (see Recipe 3). All cell lines are maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n2. To split cells, first wash cells with sterile 1x DPBS, add 2-3 ml of trypsin-EDTA to cover the surface of the plate and incubate the plate for 1-5 min at 37 °C or until cells are completely detached. Add 10 ml of complete DMEM medium or RPMI medium to inactivate trypsin. Gently pipette up and down the medium containing the inactivated trypsin to detach all cells from the plate and transfer them into a sterile 15 ml tube.\n3. Centrifuge the cells at 1,000 rpm (\\~250 x g) for 4 min at RT.\n4. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of complete DMEM medium/RPMI medium. Dilute the resuspended cells to the desired concentration in fresh complete DMEM or RPMI medium and add 1 ml to every well of the 12-well plates containing PLL treated coverslips (for PLL stock solution preparation and dilution, see Recipe 4). Incubate the plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until staining.\n\nC. Preparation of functional aptamer: folding reaction\nDuring this step, aptamers are exposed to a high temperature at an appropriate magnesium concentration which allows them to attain a proper folding prior to the staining procedure. For better results, the folding reaction should be freshly performed each time before staining. Before starting the folding reaction, prepare a stock solution diluting aptamers in 1x DPBS to a final concentration of 30 µM and store it protected from light at 4 °C.\n1. Prepare 10 µl of 10 µM functional aptamer by mixing 3.3 µl of fluorescently labelled aptamer (30 µM aptamer stock solution), 2 µl of 5x PBS (see Recipe 5), 2 µl of 5x MgCl2 (see Recipe 6) and 2.7 µl of ultrapure DNase- and RNase-free distilled water. Please note that this reaction should be carried out in PCR tubes that fit the thermal cycler.\n2. Heat up the aptamer solution to 75 °C for 3 min and then cool down to 20 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min using a thermal cycler.\n\nD. Aptamer live cells staining\n1. Aspirate the medium from the cells prepared during Procedure B, rinse briefly once with complete DMEM or RPMI depending on the cell line and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2 (in the cell culture incubator) with 500 µl/well of freshly prepared blocking solution containing sheared salmon sperm DNA and dextran sulfate (see Recipe 7).\n2. In the meantime, prepare the metal plate used for staining/incubation at 37 °C. Fix with tape a piece of Parafilm® M (large enough to fit all coverslips to be stained) on the surface. This step is demonstrated in Video 1, which shows the metal plate preparation for aptamer live staining. Note that this video is for demonstration only and this step should be performed inside a cell culture hood. Pre-heat the metal plate containing the Parafilm® M in the cell culture incubator.\n3. After blocking (step D1), carefully remove the coverslips from the 12-well plate using half-curved-forceps, remove the excess blocking solution by gently tapping the edges of the coverslips with a soft paper tissue and place the coverslips upside down on 60 µl of staining solution (complete DMEM supplemented with 100 µg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA and 250 nM folded aptamer) spotted onto the Parafilm® M fixed to the metal plate (made in step D2). This process is shown in Video 2, which demonstrates the removal of coverslips containing cells from the 12-well plates using half-curved-forceps and incubation of cells (on coverslips) with staining solution. Note that this video is for demonstration only and this step should be performed inside the cell culture hood. To avoid contamination, gloves should be sprayed with 70% ethanol. Incubate the cells for 60 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n4. After incubation, carefully take the coverslips off the metal plate using half-curved-forceps, remove the excess staining solution by gently tapping the edges of the coverslips with a soft paper tissue, and then submerge it several times in large volumes (e.g., 20-40 ml in a small beaker) of ice-cold 1x DPBS. Briefly remove the excess 1x DPBS from the coverslips by tapping them on a tissue paper and place each one (cell-side-up) into a well of a new 12-well plate filled with 1 ml/well ice-cold 4% PFA (see Recipe 8) for fixation. The washing step after the staining procedure is shown in Video 3. Note that this video is for demonstration only and 4% PFA should only be handled in the fume hood.\n5. Fix the cells for 20 min on ice and subsequently at room temperature for another 25 min. During fixation, keep the plate protected from light to avoid fluorophore bleaching.\n6. Aspirate the PFA solution and add 1 ml of quenching solution (see Recipe 9) to each well. Incubate for 15 min at room temperature protected from light.\n7. Wash twice for 5 min with 1x DPBS (1 ml/well) and mount the coverslips with Mowiol® (see Recipe 10; e.g., 8-9 µl for an 18 mm coverslip) on microscopy glass slides.\n8. Dry the mounted coverslips in an oven at 37 °C for 20-30 min or overnight at RT and store at 4 °C protected from light until imaging.", "notes": "1. To determine the saturating concentration or optimal staining concentration (best signal-to-noise ratio) for the aptamer of interest fixing the incubation time of staining (e.g., 60 min) and testing different aptamers concentrations ranging from 10-500 nM (or more) in positive cell lines is recommended. After staining with different concentrations of the aptamers, fixation and mounting, cells can be imaged in any epifluorescence microscope and fluorescent intensities can be calculated using as an example ImageJ or MATLAB.\n\n2. After defining the saturating conditions for the staining procedure, the next step is to test the binding specificity. This is achieved by evaluating the staining in the cells expressing the receptor and the cells that do not express it. Importantly, the staining conditions, the aptamer concentrations and the incubation times must be the same for both positive and negative cells. Once stained and fixed, cells can be imaged with an epifluorescence or confocal microscope. Negative cell lines should show virtually no specific fluorescent signal. For a proper control of the unspecific staining background, it is useful to test the immunolabeling with a random aptamer conjugated to the same fluorophore as the aptamer binding the specific target, in parallel. This control should not have any fluorescence signal. An additional control is the evaluation of the binding specificity by fluorescence flow cytometry analysis using the same controls.\n\n3. Every receptor has its own internalization kinetics. In this work and protocol we intend to maximize the labeling by internalization and therefore choose longer incubation times.\n\n4. If the aptamers contain BzdU (5-(N-benzylcarboxyamide)-2’-deoxyuridine) or any other hydrophobic groups, we recommend the addition of dextran sulfate to the blocking solution. An optimization of the dextran sulfate concentration in the pre-blocking solution strongly reduces the background caused by nonspecific binding due to electrostatic interaction of aptamers to the PLL-treated coverslip.\n\n5. If unspecific binding of the aptamer persists, increase the concentration of sheared salmon sperm DNA and/or dextran sulphate in the staining solution. The polyanionic competitor/blocking agent dextran sulfate also substantially reduces the nonspecific binding caused by electrostatic attraction of polyanionic aptamers to positively charged sites in nuclei, such as histones.\n\n6. For identification and quantification of endosome-like structures, colocalization studies are strongly recommended (Gomes de Castro et al., 2017)."}
{"exp_name": "An Assay to Test the Capacity of Arabidopsis Plant Defensin Type1 Protein to Induce Cellular Zinc (Zn) Tolerance in Yeast", "abstract": "Heterologous expression of genes in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) is especially suitable to functionally study the corresponding encoded protein at the cellular level (Bonneaud et al., 1991). This is mainly because many strains defective in specific activities are available and could be complemented by homologous genes existing across the eukaryotic kingdom (http://www.yeastgenome.org/). However, the protocol we describe here is not a complementation but a “gain-of-function” assay. It is based on a drop-test assay that we have set up to assess the cellular zinc tolerance conferred by the expression of heterologous genes in the wild-type S. cerevisiae. Different dilutions of a yeast culture expressing the heterologous gene of interest are grown on a range of zinc-enriched plates, and are then compared to the control yeast expressing the empty vector. Working with different concentrations of both yeast and zinc are essential to succeed in describing zinc tolerance phenotype upon yeast transformation (Mirouze et al., 2006). This test has also proven to be valuable to differentiate among related members of gene families as exemplified for Arabidopsis Plant Defensin type1 (Shahzad et al., 2013).", "materials": "1.

{"exp_name": "A Miniaturized Percoll Gradient Method for Isolation of Quiescent Cells of Yeast", "abstract": "Quiescence, the temporary and reversible exit from proliferative growth, is a fundamental biological process. Budding yeast is a preeminent model for studying cellular quiescence owing to its rich experimental toolboxes and evolutionary conservation across eukaryotic pathways and processes that control quiescence. Yeast quiescent cells are reported to be isolated by the continuous linear Percoll gradient method and identified by combining different features such as cell cycle, heat resistance, and cell morphology (single cell). Generally, 10–25 mL of Percoll isotonic solution is first obtained by mixing Percoll with NaCl in 12.5–30 mL centrifugal tubes. Then, the gradient is prepared at high speed for 15–60 min. Finally, approximately 2 × 10^9 cells are collected, overlaid onto the preformed gradient, and centrifuged to obtain distinct cell fractions. This method requires more reagents and samples and special centrifuges and centrifuge tubes. Besides the cost, it is less favorable for experiments that require high-throughput analyses with a small volume of sample each time. The protocol described here aims to solve those problems by combining the use of 2 mL centrifugal tubes with density marker beads. The protocol also focuses on how to optimize the buoyant density distribution of the density gradient solution such that the density bands better match those of different fraction cells. This will help fully separate quiescent and non-quiescent cells. The protocol can be easily adapted to a wide variety of unicellular microbes with different buoyancy density differentiation during cultivation, such as yeast and bacteria.", "materials": "Biological materials:\n1.

Optimize centrifugation time: Prepare four tubes using the Percoll isotonic solution percentage with the most uniform density marker bead band distribution according to step C1a. Centrifuge each at 20,000× g for 15, 30, 45, and 60 min, respectively.\n3. Select the Percoll isotonic solution percentage and centrifugation time resulting in the most uniform density marker beads for subsequent experiments.\n\nD. Preparation of density gradient solution and cell suspensions and centrifugation and isolation of Q and NQ cells\n1. Prepare the density gradient solution according to the optimal protocol obtained in section C (excluding step C1b).\n2. Cells preparation:\n   a. Measure the OD600 by spectrophotometry in a cuvette of the culture and take a sample greater than approximately 2 × 10^8 cells (20 OD600) in centrifugal tubes. Pellet cells according to step B2a.\n   b. Resuspend cells in 200 μL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and then vortex to mix. Pellet cells according to step B2a. Repeat until removing the culture medium.\n   c. Resuspend approximately 2 × 10^8 pelleted cells (20 OD600) in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final volume of 30 μL. Store the remaining cells at 4 °C for future analysis.\n   Note: If the volume of the cell resuspension for separation is not 30 μL, adjust the volume of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to maintain the percentage of the Percoll isotonic solution when preparing the density gradient.\n3. Centrifuge to separate the cell resuspension:\n   a. Carefully pipette the cell resuspension onto the density gradient solution by placing the pipette at the side of the 2 mL centrifuge tube.\n   b. Centrifuge the samples from step D3a and the centrifuge tube containing density marker beads with the same Percoll isotonic solution percentage from section C in a swing-bucket centrifuge at 400× g for 1 h at 16 °C.\n4. Collection of Q cells and NQ cells:\n   a. Carefully remove cells from different density layers in 2 mL centrifuge tubes, collecting the upper NQ and the lower Q fraction cells, which correspond to the coverage area of density marker beads with a density below 1.09 g/L and the area covered by the density marker bead with a density of 1.13 g/L, respectively.\n   b. Dilute the collected Q and NQ cells with sterile deionized H2O and then vortex to mix.\n   c. Pellet cells according to step B2a. Repeat until removing the density gradient solution by decanting or pipetting. Critical: Avoid salt-containing buffers during washing to avoid Percoll rebinding with ions, which could recreate a density gradient and prevent cell sedimentation at the tube bottom.\n   d. Resuspend the collected cells with 1–2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and store at 4 °C.\n   Pause point: Properly sealed, collected cell resuspension can be left at 4 ˚C for 2 weeks.\n\nE.

Resuspend pelleted cells in normal saline to a final volume of 300 μL.\n3. Plating colony-forming units (CFU):\n   a. Take 200 μL of cell resuspension in step E2 and dilute in 2 mL of normal saline. Plate 200 μL of this dilution onto several YPDA solid mediums.\n   b. Heat treatment: incubate plates at 55 °C for 1 h and then transfer to culture at 30 °C for 2 days. Non-heat treatment: Culture at 30 °C for 2 days. Have at least three sets of data for each group.\n   c. Count the number of colonies.\n   Note: This dilution is designed to plate approximately 200–400 cells when cultured at 30 °C and may need to be adjusted based on variations between spectrophotometers and strains.\n4.

Resuspend pelleted cells in normal saline to a final volume of 100 μL.\n3. Take 10 μL of cell resuspension and use DIC with a 10× eyepiece and 63× NA 1.40 oil objective lens on the LCSM.\nNote: To observe cell morphology, you can use various methods. A standard light microscope allows real-time assessment but has poor image capture. Phase-contrast microscopy offers better observation and image capture, while LCSM enables simultaneous DIC and fluorescence imaging.", "notes": "None"}

Preparation of a dissection dish:\n   Mix two kinds of silicone solutions (3.6 ml KE-106 and 0.4 ml CAT-RG) in a 35-mm culture dish (or its lid) and incubate at 37 °C for 2 days to congeal silicone. This dissection dish may be used several times. Figure 2 illustrates the dissection dish.\n\n2. Preparation of an observation tank:\n   a. Put 2 pieces of plastic tape (20 x 25 mm) on a cutting board and cut out a square (10 x 10 mm) in the center of these tapes.\n   b. Place the newly cut piece of tape on a cover slip (24 x 40 mm).\n   c. Turn over the remaining piece of tape from step 2a.\n   d.

Put the tape with insect pins from step 2d on the tape attached to the cover glass as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 illustrates the assembly of an observation tank.\n\n3. Dissection of a larva:\n   Prepare a fillet of larva on the dissection dish according to the following steps (a slightly modified larval dissection protocol from Brent et al., 2009). Use HL-3 warmed to room temperature:\n   a. Pick up a third-instar larva and wash the body surface in HL-3 solution (see Recipes). Third-instar larvae (three days after hatching at 25 °C) stop feeding behavior and climb on wall of a vial, which is referred to as wandering behavior.\n   b. Transfer the larva into 1 ml of HL-3 solution on the dissection dish.\n   c. Hold both the front and tail edges of the larva using short insect pins (red arrowheads in Figure 4A), keeping its dorsal side upward so that the tracheae (white arrows in Figure 4A) can be seen through the body wall.\n   d. Cut the body wall along the dorsal midline from the tail side (yellow dashed line in Figure 4B) to construct a fillet, holding the four corners of the body wall with short pins (red arrowheads in Figures 4C and 4D).\n   e. Carefully remove the gut, fat bodies and salivary glands without injuring the ventral ganglion (orange arrows in Figures 4E and 4F), axons or body muscles. Fluorescence will be observed within the ventral ganglion (yellow dashed circles in Figures 4G and 4H) and axons (white arrowheads in Figures 4G and 4H) when using flies that express fluorescence markers in motor neurons. The green fluorescence signals in Figures 4F and 4H are derived from preproANF-EMD. Figure 4 illustrates the dissection procedure for a larval fillet on a dissection dish. Scale bars = 1 mm for (A-F) and 5 µm for (G, H).\n\n4. Placement of a larva in observation tank:\n   a. Carefully remove the short pins from the larva and transfer the larva to the observation tank filled with HL-3.\n   b. Extend the head and tail of the larva carefully and secure them with pins (epidermis side up, as shown in Figure 5). Rinse by changing the HL-3 solution twice and put a cover glass (18 x 18 mm) to protect the larva against desiccation. Note: There is no need to hold the cover glass with nail polish. An organic solvent in nail polish could affect the neuronal activity.\n   Figure 5 illustrates the setting for an inverted microscope. A. Top view of an observation tank where a larval fillet is retained. B. Enlarged top view of a larval fillet retained with two pins in an observation tank. C. Larval motor neuron axons are observed from below using a 40x objective.\n\n5. Imaging:\n   a. Locate a motor neuron axon (as shown in Figure 6A) under an inverted fluorescence microscope. A laser-scanning microscope equipped with a high sensitivity detector is preferable.\n   b. Capture live images every 0.1 sec for 30 sec under a 40x objective lens (as shown in Videos 1 and 2). To ensure that healthy neurons are imaged, it is important to complete the dissection within 5 min and subsequent observation within 5 min. Note: We usually use motor neuron axons projecting to the A6 muscles (as shown in Figure 4I). See also Figure 1A in Matzat et al., 2015. Choosing specific axons and observation of the same axonal region may be important to evaluate transport property.\n   Video 1 shows a representative movie of axonal flow of the dense core vesicles in TBPH+/- flies. The genotype used is UAS-preproANF-EMD/+; TBPHΔ23/+; D42-Gal4/+.\n   Video 2 shows a representative movie of axonal flow of the dense core vesicles in TBPH+/- flies expressing p150Glued. The genotype used is UAS-preproANF-EMD/+; TBPHΔ23/UAS-p150Glued-HA; D42-Gal4/+.\n\n6. Data Analysis:\n   6.1. Constructing a kymograph:\n      Construct a kymograph using ImageJ software by using the ‘Image > Stacks > Reslice’ menu (as shown in Figure 6). The Reslice menu makes kymographs from each line ROI (X-axis ROI), which is set automatically on the stacked images. The resultant kymographs consist of stacked data for each line ROI. ‘Output spacing’ and ‘Avoid interpolation’ are parameters to define the size of Y-axis ROI. Because one line ROI cannot track vesicles snaking through the axon, appropriate setting of ‘Output spacing’ is required. ‘Z-Projection’ image from all stacked kymographs represents vesicle movements in the defined ROI during all observation time.\n      Detailed steps for kymograph generation (as shown in Figure 6):\n      1) Open stacked images. To crop images, see an explanation in the box.\n      2) Select ‘Image > Stacks > Reslice’ menu.\n      3) Input an appropriate value in ‘Output spacing’ and check ‘Avoid interpolation’. ‘Output spacing’ defines the size of Y-axis ROI and we used 0.152.\n      4) Resultant resliced images represent kymographs of non-interpolated X-axis ROI (each pixel-line from top to bottom).\n      5) ‘Image > Stacks > Z-Projection’ menu merges all of stacked kymographs. Select ‘Max Intensity’ tab in the Z-Projection window.\n      6) Then, a merged kymograph appears.\n      Note: To select a whole axon area, use Area selection tools as shown in the box of Figure 6. Figure 6 illustrates the generation of a kymograph from stacked images.\n\n   6.2. Removing stationary vesicles:\n      Use the ‘Image Calculator > Operation: Subtract’ menu to remove stationary vesicles from the kymograph (as shown in Figure 7).\n      Detailed steps for image processing to extract moving vesicles (as shown in Figure 7):\n      1) Open stacked images and its first image. Select ‘Process > Image Calculator’ menu.\n      2) Refer to the stacked images as Image1 and its first image as Image2. Select ‘Subtract’ tab in the ‘Image calculator’ window.\n      3) Signals in the stacked images are automatically subtracted from those in its first image.\n      4) The resultant images represent moving signals.\n\n   6.3. Interpretation of results:\n      The kymographs obtained through the procedures described in Figure 6 and Figure 7 can indicate, for example, that the overexpression of a dynein motor component p150Glued in TBPH+/- larvae inhibits axonal transport of dense core vesicles in both directions (as shown in Figure 8). Detailed data processing analysis and replicates including applied statistical tests could be found in the original manuscript, see Hosaka et al., 2017.\n      Figure 8 illustrates typical imaging results of axonal transport. A. The dense core vesicles (green) in motor neuron axons of the indicated genotypes. B. Kymographs show motility of the dense core vesicles. The X-axis represents the position of the dense core vesicle, and the Y-axis is time (moving from top to bottom). Vertical lines correspond to stationary dense core vesicles, and diagonal lines are moving dense core vesicles. Anterograde movements have positive slopes, whereas retrograde movements have negative slopes. These kymographs were obtained by the methods described in Figure 6. C. Resultant images after subtraction extract moving dense core vesicles as described in Figure 7.", "notes": "None"}

Botrytis cinerea is a fungal pathogen that causes gray mold disease on many crops, including strawberries. Disease monitoring is an important aspect for growing commercial crops like strawberry because there is an urgent need to develop effective strategies to control this destructive gray mold disease. In this protocol, we provide an important tool to monitor the gray mold fungal infection progression in different developmental stages of strawberry. There are different types of inoculation assays for B. cinerea on strawberry plants, such as in vitro (in/on a culture medium) or in vivo (in a living plant). In vivo inoculation assays can be performed at early, middle, and late stages of strawberry development. Here, we describe three methods for in vivo inoculation assays of B. cinerea on strawberry plants. For early-stage strawberry plants, we modified the traditional fungal disc inoculation method to apply to fungal infection on strawberry leaves. For middle-stage strawberry plants, we developed the flower infection assay by dropping fungal conidia onto flowers. For late-stage strawberry plants, we tracked the survival rate of strawberry fruits after fungal conidia infection. This protocol has been successfully used in both lab and greenhouse conditions.

The fungal discs' mycelia side was firmly attached to the upside of strawberry leaves with micropore tapes. A sterilized needle was used to wound the leaf and facilitate fungal penetration. Sterile water was sprayed on infected leaves and enclosed in a sandwich bag to maintain relative high humidity. A dark-brown necrosis lesion was detected on the inoculated leaves at 4 dpi, and the lesion diameter was measured for data analysis.\n\n3. Strawberry flower inoculation (Middle-stage)\n    a. Wash fungal conidia from the agar plates with sterile water.\n    b. Filter washed conidia with sterile lens paper to a 2 mL tube and centrifuge to enrich the conidia.\n    c. Dilute the conidia with half-strength V8 medium to appropriate concentration by counting conidia under a light microscope (10x objective) using a hemocytometer. We used the following formula to calculate the conidial concentration using the hemocytometer: conidia concentration = N × 10^4 conidia/mL, where N is the number of conidia counted under the 10x objective (when 10 μL of conidial solution was applied to the hemocytometer).\n    d. Adjust the conidial suspension to the final inoculum concentration as needed. For example, we used 100 conidia/mL suspension (20 μL drop) to inoculate middle-stage (\\~3-month-old) strawberry flowers.\n    e. Spray sterile water to the inside of a plastic bag (e.g., sandwich bag) and use it to cover the inoculated flower carefully.\n    f.

A 20 μL droplet of conidia suspension was inoculated in the middle-stage (\\~3-month-old) newly opened strawberry flower and enclosed into a sandwich bag pre-sprayed with sterile water to maintain high relative humidity. Four days later, disease symptoms of inoculated flowers were scored on a 0–4 scale and further analyzed.\n\n4. Strawberry fruit inoculation (Late-stage)\n    a. Prepare the conidia inoculum as above in steps B.3.a–B.3.e, with the exception that newly emerging fruits (\\~3.5-month-old) are inoculated instead of flowers.\n    b. Record the disease development at 4, 8, and 12 dpi. We counted the number of healthy and diseased fruits at 12 dpi.\n    c. Analyze the data. We calculated the survival rate using this formula: survival rate (%) = the number of healthy fruits/the number of total fruits × 100. “LD” stands for inoculation with low dosage of fungal conidia (100 conidia/mL). “HD” stands for inoculation with fungal high dosage of fungal conidia (5,000 conidia/mL) (two-tailed unpaired t-test).\n    *Procedure of evaluating fruit survival rate to Botrytis cinerea infection at the late-flowering to early-fruiting stage: Inoculated newly emerging fruits (\\~3.5-month-old) were monitored until 12 dpi to evaluate fruit development and its survival rate to overcome the gray mold disease.", "notes": "None"}

Here, we describe a protocol for the isolation and in vitro expansion of highly pure mouse and human SCs based on ice-cold treatment (ICT). The ICT is carried out by briefly incubating the dish containing a heterogeneous mix of adherent muscle mononuclear cells on ice for 15-30 min, which leads to the detachment only of the SCs, and gives rise to SC cultures with 95-100% purity. This approach can also be used to passage the cells, allowing SC expansion over extended periods of time without compromising their proliferation or differentiation potential.

Collect the tibialis anterior, quadriceps, and gastrocnemius muscles from both legs (referencing Figure 2).\n      e. Place the dissected muscles in a 60 mm dish containing DMEM supplemented with 1% pen/strep, and remove any hair to minimize the risk of contamination.\n      f.

Day 1: Muscle digestion I (referencing Figure 1c).\n      a. Aspirate the supernatant with a 10 ml serological pipette and resuspend the minced muscles in 10 ml of collagenase type II digestion solution per gram of tissue (see Recipes).

Wash the dishes containing the heterogeneous mix of adhered muscle cells three times with 10 ml of PBS (with MgCl2 and CaCl2) at RT. Note: Gently pipette PBS all around the dish.\n      b. Add 10 ml of ice-cold PBS (without MgCl2 and CaCl2) to each 100 mm dish. Note: Both PBS with or without CaCl2 can be used. However, using PBS without CaCl2 will facilitate detachment.\n      c. Fill a polystyrene box with ice (0°C) and place the dishes on top of the ice for 15-30 min with occasional gentle manual shaking of the dish (creating a swirling motion). Notes: i. If purity is of utmost importance (e.g., 99-100% purity), the dishes should not be kept on ice for longer than 30 min. Nevertheless, the dishes can be kept on ice for up to 1 h to increase cell yield, with purity still high at 90%. ii. The original dishes (from day 1 of the isolation procedure) containing heterogeneous muscle cells can be kept up to day 3 of culture and used for further rounds of ICTs.\n      d. Collect the detached cells into a 50 ml tube.\n      e. Wash the original dish once more with 10 ml of PBS to collect the remaining detached cells. Note: Gently pipette PBS all around the dish.\n      f. Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\n      g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in growth medium.\n      h.

Plate the cells into 35 mm dishes precoated with 0.1% gelatin, at a density of 10^3 cells/dish and place them into a cell incubator. Note: At this density, the SC proliferate for up to three days. Afterward, they begin to differentiate. Increasing the plating density will accelerate the time it takes for the myoblasts to differentiate and fuse into myotubes.\n    7. Cell culture\n      a. Culture the cells in growth medium, changing the medium every two days.\n      b. To induce myoblast differentiation, remove growth medium and replace it with differentiation medium (see Recipes) once the cells reach 80% confluency.\n    8. Cell passaging\n      a. Place the dishes containing proliferating SCs on ice for up to 30 min.\n      b. Follow the steps described in I.A.6.\n  B. Isolation of human muscle satellite cells\n    Notes:\n      a. Experimental procedures using human muscle biopsies should be performed only after obtaining ethical approval and informed consent.\n      b. The number of SCs obtained from human muscle biopsies may vary depending on the age of the donor, with a smaller number of cells typically obtained from older donors.\n    1.

Note: On average, 2 × 10^6 muscle mononuclear cells can be obtained from digestion of 1 g of human muscle biopsy.\n    5. Pre-plating: Proceed as in I.A.5.\n    6. ICT: Proceed as in I.A.6. To further enrich in SCs the heterogeneous muscle cell culture on day 1 after isolation, it may be necessary to grow it for an additional 3-4 days before proceeding to ICT (when the culture reaches a confluency of about 80%). Notes: a. On average, 1 × 10^4 SCs can be collected after the first ICT. b. A further 2 × 10^4 SCs can be collected after the second or third ICT at 48 h or 72 h of culture.\n    7. Cell culture: Proceed as in Step I.A.7. Note: Human SCs proliferate slower than mouse SCs, with a doubling time of 46 h.\nII.

Sample preparation\nExchangable protons in the sample are treated to a deuterium exchange regime before NMR analysis:\na. Add D2O (1 ml) to a sample (\\~12 mg) of the glucosaminoglycan in an Eppendorf tube and agitate the sample to complete dissolution.\nb. The sample is freeze dried in the ‘loosely capped’ tube and this process repeated twice more.\nc. Finally, the sample is made up with D2O (0.7 ml) containing 0.2 mg/ml t-BuOH as an internal reference (δ 1H 1.24 ppm) and transferred to the NMR tube for analysis.\n\n2. Sample concentration\nThe concentration of 17 mg/ml has been found to be the minimum necessary for highly reproducible 2-dimensional NMR. The 1H NMR spectra of this class of compound is significantly affected by pH, cross-linking capable species (e.g., Ca2+) and the salt form of the sulfated moieties (Liu et al., 2009; Guerrini et al., 2008). If such contamination is suspected, the sample should be converted to the sodium salt and dialysed (3,500 MW cutoff) against water exhaustively, before freeze-drying and deuterium exchange.\n\n3. Data collection\na. Spectra were collected at 30 °C on a three-channel Bruker Avance III 500 (installed August 2007). Proton frequency was 499.843 MHz and the probe was a Bruker two channel 5-mm broadband observe nuclei probe (31P-109Ag) equipped with actively shielded 50-G/cm Zaxis Pulsed Field Gradients (PFG).\nb. Data acquisition used a spectral width of 10,302 Hz, 65,536 data points, 30-degree excitation pulse, 32 transients, each with a 2-sec delay time and an FID acquisition time of 1.59 sec.\nc. Spectra with solvent-suppression were recorded: low-power continuous-wave presaturation was followed by a composite-observe pulse utilizing the ‘zgcppr’ Bruker sequence (software Topspin 2.6).\n\n4. Data analysis\na. The individual GAG’s are readily identified by their distinctive 1H NMR spectra. Figure 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra (D2O, 25 °C, with HDO suppression, referenced to t-BuOH) of heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfate, where Chondroitin-A is a mixture of chondroitins A&C. The presence of contaminating chondroitin or dermatan sulfate in a sample of heparan sulfate or heparin is apparent by examination of the glycosaminoglycan acetate resonances (Carnachan, 2016). For both heparin and heparan sulfate this acetate resonance occurs at δ 2.034 ppm and any additional acetate resonance downfield indicates the presence of other GAG’s (see Figure 2, which shows the 1H NMR spectra of the acetate methyl resonances (D2O, 25 °C, with HDO suppression, referenced to t-BuOH) of heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates and dermatan sulfate, where Chondroitin-A is a mixture of chondroitins A&C). In addition, heparin and heparan sulfate have resonances at δ 3.25, 3.37 and > 5.0 ppm that distinguish them from chondroitins or dermatan.\nb. By way of demonstration, 1H NMR spectra that are typical of those recorded during a purification process from Heparanoid (see Note 6) are presented in Figure 3. Figure 3 displays the 1H NMR spectra of Heparanoid and partially purified fractions obtained from DEAE-Sepharose chromatographic separation, including: A. Very crude Heparanoid with significant protein contribution; B. Heparanoid - different batch to A; C and D. GAG mixtures that have a significant proportion of heparin-like materials; E. Fraction that is > 85% HS (D2O, 25 °C, with HDO suppression [discontinuous peak at δ 4.6 ppm], referenced to t-BuOH).\nc. The co-occurrence of the heparin and heparan sulfate N-acetate methyl resonances at δ 2.034 ppm make using this peak for assessing the relative proportion of these species in a sample problematic. However, the intensity of this peak relative to the remainder of the spectrum can be indicative of whether a sample is more heparan sulfate-like, or, more heparin-like. The peak height for the acetate resonance of heparin is equivalent to the peak height of the methine resonances observed at δ \\~3.8 ppm, while for heparan sulfate the acetate resonance is \\~2.5 fold greater than the methine resonances (see Figure 2). Low levels (even up to < 15%) of contaminating heparin in a sample of heparan sulfate are very difficult to confirm or quantitate by 1H NMR (Keire et al., 2010), and are more readily assessed using 2-D NMR techniques (Guerrini et al., 2005).\nd. A semi-quantitative purity assessment can be undertaken for samples containing primarily one GAG (> 90%). Using a known concentration of t-BuOH in D2O and a pure sample of a particular GAG a standard curve may be generated. GAG was weighed out accurately into \\~10, 5, 2 and 0.5 mg aliquots and made up with exactly 1.0 ml of t-BuOH standard solution for NMR analysis. Using integrated areas, the ratio of the acetate peak of the GAG divided by the t-BuOH resonance plotted against the known amount of GAG in solution generates a straight-line relation (Figure 4, which is a standard curve plotting the ratio of acetate and internal-standard resonances (integrated areas from 1H NMR) against the known mass of HS (> 95% w/w) in the sample (t-BuOH standard solution 0.20 mg/ml)). A sample of unknown purity made up in the same concentration and volume of t-BuOH solution can therefore be assessed for purity compared to the reference material. Such a standard curve is particularly useful in assessing possible contributions from salt and water concentrations that are effectively invisible to this NMR analysis and not trivial to measure in a non-destructive manner on small samples (< 5 mg).", "notes": "1. GAG’s, either as a dry lyophilized solid or as a dilute solution (D2O, 5 °C) are stable indefinitely (> 5 yr). Dry solids appear to undergo no degradation over time either at room temperature (RT) or freezer conditions (to -70 °C).   \n2. Completing the D2O exchange process has only a subtle effect on the NMR spectra, and so for routine analysis or during purification-monitoring this step is often omitted.   \n3. Concentrated samples (> 60 mg/ml) (prepared for example for 13C analysis or rapid 2-D NMR techniques) exhibit significant line broadening and chemical shift changes in the 1H NMR spectrum, thus reference 1H NMR must be recorded as dilute solutions only.   \n4. We have demonstrated in the laboratory that freshly lyophilized HS will adsorb 13% w/w of water on standing. This is a reproducible mass gain on standing and readily-reversible process by lyophilization. Samples are routinely stored at -70 °C and so are allowed to warm to RT in airtight containers before exposure to the atmosphere to minimize water uptake during handling.   \n5. The presence of salts can be subjectively noted by the physical appearance of the GAG. Heparin and HS are fluffy white ‘cotton-wool’ like solids. The presence of salt at \\~> 10% w/w generates a more rigid, tough off-white solid which adsorbs atmospheric water at an accelerated rate compared to the de-salted material. This is particularly important to note for weighing small amounts of HS that are subsequently entering a dose-response bioassay.   \n6. Heparanoid is a complex mixture of GAG’s recovered from the side-streams produced in the production of Heparin from porcine mucosa. The composition of material described as Heparanoid varies significantly (see Figures 3i and 3ii), dependant on which side-streams of the Heparin process are combined. Thus the levels of protein, individual GAG’s (including Heparin), salts and other biological materials can vary wildly in individually sourced materials and discrete batches. One method (Shworak, 2001) of purifying HS is partitioning on a diethylaminoethylSepharose (DEAE-Sepharose) column. Column elution may be achieved by step-wise increments in ionic strength (e.g., sodium chloride in phosphate buffer). For analysis by NMR fractions are desalted (dialysis), lyophilized and the resultant amorphous white solid exchanged with D2O before 1H NMR spectra recorded (unpublished work)."}

Propagate and purify reovirus virions as previously described (Berard and Coombs, 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2010). Using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, determine particle concentration by measuring the optical density of the purified virus stocks at 260 nm (OD260; 1 unit at OD260 = 2.1 x 10^12 particles/ml) (Smith et al., 1969).\n    b. In 1 tube of an 8-well tube strip, dilute 2 x 10^11 virions into 90 µl of ice cold VB (see Recipes).\n    c. Add 10 µl of ice cold 2 mg/ml TLCK-treated chymotrypsin (see Recipes) to the diluted virus. Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times. Note: For an undigested control, substitute 10 µl of ice cold VB for 10 µl of TLCK-treated chymotrypsin.\n    d. Incubate the reaction for 20 min at 32 °C in a thermal cycler. Note: Under these conditions, σ3 is degraded (Joklik, 1972; Borsa et al., 1973a) and µ1 is cleaved (Nibert and Fields, 1992; Chandran et al., 1999).\n    e. Following digestion, quench chymotrypsin activity by the addition of 1 µl of 100 mM PMSF (see Recipes). Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.\n    f. Incubate the reaction for 20 min on ice.\n    g. To confirm that ISVPs are generated, run 2 x 10^10 particles per lane on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini gel. Run the gel for 40-45 min at 200 V constant.\n    h. Visualize the protein bands by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (see Data analysis, Figure 1).\n    i. Store ISVPs on ice, and use within 2-3 h for hemolysis experiments.\n\n2. Preparation of bovine red blood cells (RBCs)\n    a. Perform all steps on ice or at 4 °C.\n    b. Transfer 1 ml of citrated bovine calf blood to a microcentrifuge tube. Note: Citrated bovine calf blood should be used within 2 weeks of the draw date.\n    c. Pellet the RBCs by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min. Note: RBCs are the source of membranes for hemolysis experiments.\n    d. Aspirate and discard the supernatant.\n    e. Resuspend the RBCs in 1 ml of ice cold PBSMg (see Recipes). Mix by gently pipetting up and down.\n    f. Repeat Steps 2c-2e until the supernatant remains clear after pelleting.\n    g. Resuspend the washed RBCs in ice cold PBSMg at a 30%(vol/vol) concentration. Mix by gently flicking the side of the tube. Note: Estimate the RBC pellet volume by using the volume markers on the microcentrifuge tube.\n    h. Store RBCs on ice, and use immediately for hemolysis experiments.\n\n3. ISVP-induced hemolysis assay\n    a. In separate microcentrifuge tubes, assemble the following reactions on ice:\n        i. 33.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs (0% hemolysis control)\n        ii. 30.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs + 3 µl 10% TX-100 (100% hemolysis control, see Recipes)\n        iii. 3.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs + 30 µl ISVPs\n    b. Mix the reactions by gently flicking the side of the tubes.\n    c. Incubate the reactions for 1 h (T3D reovirus) or for 2 h (T1L reovirus) at 37 °C in a water bath. Note: Under these conditions, ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion is induced (Chandran et al., 2002; Sarkar and Danthi, 2010) and the µ1-derived pore forming peptides are released (Nibert et al., 1991; Chandran et al., 2002; Odegard et al., 2004; Nibert et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Agosto et al., 2006; Ivanovic et al., 2008).\n    d. Place the reactions on ice for 20 min.\n    e. Pellet intact RBCs by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min. Note: This step should be performed at 4 °C.\n    f. Transfer 20 µl of each supernatant to individual wells of a 96-well plate.\n    g. Dilute each transferred supernatant with 80 µl of VB. Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.\n    h. To quantify the amount of hemoglobin released (i.e., RBC lysis), measure the absorbance (A) of the diluted supernatants at 405 nm using a microplate reader. A values are recorded on SoftMax Pro software.\n    i. Calculate the percent hemolysis (see Data analysis).\n\n4. Data Analysis\n    a. Generation of infectious subviral particles (ISVPs)\n        i. Record and analyze the results using a gel imaging system and Image Studio Lite software. Figure 1 shows an SDS-PAGE gel of reovirus virions and ISVPs.\n        ii. Virions contain λ1,2,3, µ1C, σ2, and σ3.\n        iii. ISVPs contain λ1,2,3, µ1C, δ, and σ2.\n        Note: The appearance of δ, the loss of µ1C, and the loss of σ3 indicate the transition from virions to ISVPs. λ1,2,3 and σ2 should remain unchanged.\n    b. ISVP-induced hemolysis assay\n        i. All hemolysis experiments should be repeated for at least three independent replicates.\n        ii. Calculate the percent hemolysis using the following formula:\n            [(Asample - Abuffer)/(ATX-100 - Abuffer)] x 100\n            - Abuffer represents the supernatant derived from VB and RBCs.\n            - ATX-100 represents the supernatant derived from VB, RBCs, and TX-100.\n            - Asample represents the supernatant derived from VB, RBCs, and ISVPs.\n        iii. When comparing the hemolytic capacity of different reovirus strains, calculate P values using Student’s t-test.\n        iv. Use graphing software to plot percent hemolysis.\n        Note: For T3D reovirus, 40-60% hemolysis is typically observed after 1 h incubation at 37 °C.", "notes": "1.

Aspirate the pellet in 20 ml wash solution, and transfer the solution in a fresh tube. Do not aspirate up and down!\n16. Centrifuge, 720 x g, 5 min, 18 °C.\n17. Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml culture medium 30% and transfer it on a well of a 6-well culture dish.\n18. Check the quality of isolated acinar tissue under the microscope. Isolation is good if you see clusters of acinar cells (epithelial explants, the morphology is similar to control acinar explants) and only rare isolated acinar cells swimming around. Sometimes damaged acinar cells agglomerate together, remove such sticky agglomerates with a forceps.\n19. Let the isolated acini recover for 60 min in the incubator (37 °C with 5% CO2).\n20. Meanwhile precoat a cell culture plate of the desired size with collagen (as described in the Gelation Procedure above). Calculate the required volume of collagen - medium mixture required for step 24. The volume depends on your application. Calculated 100 μl volume/well for a 48-well plate or 80 μl volume/well for an 8 well chamber slide. Typically you will seed the acinar explants obtained from one wild type mice in 15 wells of a 48 well plate. In this case you need 100 µl x 15/2 = 750 µl collagen and 100 µl x 15/2 = 750 µl medium 0.1%.\n21. Collect the acinar suspension from the plate and transfer it to a fresh 15 ml tube.\n22. Centrifuge acinar suspension, 720 x g, 5 min, 18 °C.\n23. Carefully aspirate the supernatant.\n24. Resuspend the pellet in a mixture of collagen and culture medium 0.1% (1:1 vol./vol.).\n25. Pipette the acini/collagen-medium suspension mixture into each coated well in the plate (at least in triplicate). For the typical 48-well example you pipette 100 µl of the mixture in 15 wells.\n26. Wait until solidification of the collagen (about 30 min).\n27. Add some more collagen (100 µl/well for the 48 well plate). You may skip this step when you will perform immunofluorescence as a downstream application. Wait until solidification (about 30 min).\n28. Add culture medium 0.1% with/without the desired supplements to each well. Typically 400 µl/well for a 48 well plate.\n29. To induce transdifferentiation of acinar explants, add TGFa (10 ng/ml) or EGF (25 ng/ml) into the culture medium 0.1% at day 1-3-5 where day 1 is the day of isolation.", "notes": "None"}

Typhoon Biomolecular Imager (GE/Amersham, model: 8600)", "procedures": "This methodology is predicated on locating sites in the primary structure of OM or soluble binding proteins that tolerate Cys substitution and chemical modification with extrinsic fluorophores. Using either crystallographic data or structural models [e.g., from the MODELLER algorithm of CHIMERA (Pettersen et al., 2004)], accessible sites are predicted. Single Cys residues are genetically engineered at those locations, and the resulting Cys mutant proteins are subjected to labeling with fluorophores. Regardless of the basis of such predictions, the extent of labeling and biochemical functionality of each construct must be experimentally verified. Consequently, for each protein of interest, 4–6 candidate target residues are selected, mutagenized to substitute Cys, and evaluated for expression, susceptibility to alkylation with different maleimide fluorophores, and overall sensitivity to interactions with ligands.\n\nFor a protein whose tertiary or quaternary structure is fully delineated, candidate residues are picked with side chains that project near its ligand binding site, such that adsorption of a ligand may result in the quenching of an attached fluorophore. For example, Escherichia coli FepA (EcoFepA) binds the siderophore ferric enterobactin (FeEnt) in the loops of its surface vestibule (Smallwood et al., 2014). Its crystal structure (Buchanan et al., 1999) correctly predicted that Cys mutant proteins EcoFepA_S271C and EcoFepA_A698C are accessible to fluoresceination, and then sensitive to FeEnt binding (Smallwood et al., 2014). For Klebsiella pneumoniae IroN (KpnIroN), which is not yet structurally solved but has 82% identity to EcoFepA, the guideline that >25% sequence identity predicts an identical overall protein fold (Ginalski, 2006; StokesRees and Sliz, 2010) was relied upon. To determine labeling targets in KpnIroN, CLUSTALW was used to align it with EcoFepA [PDB sequence 1FEP (Buchanan et al., 1999)], and then the MODELLER of CHIMERA (UCSF) was employed to predict KpnIroN tertiary structure, including surface loops. This led to the selection and engineering of mutant KpnIroN_T210C, located in L2, that is quantitatively modified by FM (Chakravorty et al., 2019).\n\nAs a general approach, PCR is used to clone a binding protein of interest from the chromosomes of a particular bacterial species. When the sensors originate from E. coli OMPs, the nucleotide sequences encoding their mature proteins are cloned and inserted downstream from the native promoter of EcofepA in pITS23 (Scott et al., 2001), which is a derivative of the low-copy pHSG575 (Takeshita et al., 1987). Cys substitution mutants in proteins may be generated by a variety of methods; QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent) of the wild-type genes on pITS23 (Ma et al., 2007) is used, with complementary oligonucleotides flanking the mutation, following the manufacturer’s instructions. After confirming the mutations by sequencing (Genewiz) of purified plasmids, the sensor proteins are expressed and fluorescently labeled in intact cells, which may be stored frozen at -70 \\°C. If the desired sensor derives from a soluble binding protein, then the relevant structural genes are cloned in plasmid pET28a, which adds a 6-histidine (6H)-tag at either the N- or C-termini of the mature protein, and purified by metal ion affinity chromatography (Talon Superflow, Takara Bio Inc.).\n\nAlthough other plasmid systems are likely also acceptable, the vector for OMP production, pITS23 (Scott, 2000), carries wild-type EcofepA under control of its native, Fur-regulated promoter. For expression of other E. coli OMP sensors, EcofepA in pITS23 is precisely replaced with the alternate OMP structural gene (with its own signal sequence), such that the iron-regulated EcofepA promoter controls biosynthesis of the OM protein. For OM proteins of other bacterial species, the sequence encoding mature EcoFepA is replaced with the sequence encoding the foreign, mature OM protein, downstream from the EcoFepA signal sequence, and regulated by the EcofepA promoter. This approach allows for the EcoFepA signal sequence to direct secretion and assembly of the foreign OMP in the E. coli OM. Next, appropriate conditions for high-level expression of the OM sensor proteins of interest are chosen. The E. coli host OKN1359 is utilized, because its inability to make enterobactin (entA) or to transport iron (\\ΔtonB) leads to overexpression of iron-regulated sensor proteins during growth in iron-deficient MOPS media (Chakravorty et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2022). Additionally, OKN1359 is devoid of several OM proteins (\\Δfiu, \\ΔfepA, \\Δcir), which facilitates expression of foreign OM proteins. The Cys mutant constructs are exposed in situ, in living cells, to FM or other fluorophore maleimides (e.g., coumarin maleimides and Alexa Fluor maleimides). The expression and labeling of each cloned OMP is evaluated by growing bacteria harboring the appropriate plasmid construct in MOPS medium to late log phase (A600 nm = 2.5–3.5), and analyzing SDS-PAGE resolved samples, or performing immunoblots of bacterial OM or soluble purified protein fractions, to visualize the production and extent of modification of the sensor proteins. For soluble binding proteins, a 6H-tagged Cys mutant protein is purified from cell lysate by metal affinity chromatography (e.g., Talon Superflow, Takara Bio Inc.), modified with FM or other fluorophore maleimides, and re-purified the fluorescently labeled sensor by acetone precipitation or gel filtration chromatography.\n\nStep-by-step protocol:\n1. Grow sensor strains to maximize Cys-mutant OMP expression, or purify soluble Cys-mutant binding proteins. For modifications with fluorophore maleimides, inoculate bacteria harboring plasmids that encode a Cys mutant OMP from frozen stocks into LB, grow the strain with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 \\°C overnight, and subculture at 1% into MOPS minimal media with shaking (200 rpm) at 37 \\°C for 10–12 h, until late exponential phase.\n2. For bacteria, determine cell density from absorbance at 600 nm; for purified proteins, determine the concentration from absorbance at 280 nm.\n3. Collect bacterial cells by centrifugation at 7,500 \\times g for 15 min; wash with and resuspend in the same volume of 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7. Repeat. For soluble binding proteins, dialyze the solution of purified protein (1–5 mg/mL) overnight, using appropriate molecular weight–cutoff tubing or membrane, against 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7.\n4. Prepare fluorescein 5' maleimide (FM) stock solution: Use a micropipettor tip to transfer a small amount of FM powder to 0.5 mL of anhydrous DMF or DMSO. Determine the concentration of this stock solution from its absorbance at 488 nm in 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8 (\\εmM = 80). The stock solution may be stored at -20 \\°C.\n5. Labeling reaction: Calculate the appropriate dilution factor of the stock, and then label the bacterial cells or purified proteins in 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7, by adding FM to a final concentration of 5 \\μM, at 37 \\°C for 15 min. Terminate the labeling reaction by adding \\β-mercaptoethanol to 140 \\μM, which instantaneously reacts with excess fluorophore maleimide.\n6. Post-labeling processing and storage: After collecting the fluoresceinated cells by centrifugation at 7,500 \\times g for 15 min, wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspend the labeled bacteria in PBS. Immediately use the labeled cells in spectroscopic experiments or rest them on ice (up to 24 h), or add glycerol to 15% and store them (indefinitely) as 1-mL aliquots at -70 \\°C. In the latter case, after thawing the labeled cells, pellet them by centrifugation in a microfuge, wash them once, and resuspend them in PBS. For evaluation of protein expression or the extent of FM-labeling, solubilize aliquots of the cell suspensions with sample buffer, and subject them to SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, first visualize the extent of labeling with a fluorescence imager (Typhoon 8600GE/Amersham), and then stain the gels with Coomassie blue R (Ames, 1974).\n7. Assess the efficacy of covalent modification by diluting aliquots of fluoresceinated cells or proteins in PBS in a fluorometer; analyze with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 520 nm. Calculate the specific fluorescence of the samples (fluorescence intensity/10\\^9 cells or /mg protein).\n8. Measure the extent of fluorescence quenching by natural ligands: Observe fluorophore-labeled cells in a fluorometer (e.g., OLIS-SLM AMINCO 8100 or OLIS Clarity). For binding determinations, deposit 2.5 \\times 10\\^7 labeled cells in a quartz cuvette (final volume: 2 mL) with stirring at 37 \\°C, measure the initial fluorescence (F0), and then add increasing concentrations of a ligand, while monitoring the quenching of fluorescence emissions (F) at 520 nm. Use, store on ice (up to 24 h), or preserve at -70 \\°C in 10% glycerol.", "notes": "1. Host bacteria OM proteins from many Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, K. pneumoniae (Kumar et al., 2022), Acinetobacter baumannii (Nairn et al., 2017), Caulobacteri crescentus (Balhesteros et al., 2017) and more, are susceptible to FM labeling in situ, in the cell envelopes of those living cells. However, the cell surface of laboratory E. coli is a preferred environment for expression and labeling of both native and foreign OM proteins, because it is not obscured by an LPS O-antigen nor capsular polysaccharide. Hence, we perform most labeling reactions in laboratory E. coli host strains.   \n2. Protein expression It is advisable to adopt a cloning/expression strategy that maximizes production of the target OM protein. We use iron-regulated Fur promoters in conjunction with iron-deficient MOPS media, to maximize the expression of foreign proteins in E. coli. However, other promoters (e.g., lac or tac) are equally effective.   \n3. Media for bacterial growth and target protein expression As a result of the iron-regulated promoters in our experiments, we utilize MOPS minimal media, that is a complete minimal media for Enterobacteriaceae (Neidhardt et al., 1974), and readily rendered iron-deficient by excluding FeSO4 and tricine from its formulation. We have no experience with the chemical modification of cells grown in other defined media or broths, but we anticipate that regardless of growth media, preliminary washing with 50 mM NaHPO4, pH 6.7, will lead to efficacious maleimide labeling reactions."}

Weight 500 mg of tissue into a microfuge tube and add 900 µl of extraction buffer 1 (EB1) (for fruit tissue the ratio of powered tissue/EB is 1:1.8, w/v. This ratio may need to be increased to 1:3 for leaf tissue).\n4. Keep on ice while preparing all samples and vortex for 30 sec.\n5. Centrifuge 15 min at 4 °C and 13,000 x g.

Measure immediately PEPCK activity or the aliquots of clarified extracts can be snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C for future use.\n\nPEPCK activity measurement:\nThe activity of PEPCK is measured in carboxylation direction by following oxidation of NADH at 340 nm at 25 °C. Briefly, a continuous assay is used in which OAA produced by PEPCK is immediately reduced to malate, and this is achieved by the inclusion of malate dehydrogenase. The oxidation of NADH by malate dehydrogenase is measured at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer.\n1. Accurately pipette 2-10 µl of clarified extract into a microplate well.\n2. Use a repeat pipettor to add 150 µl PEPCK assay mix 1 to each well and immediately place in microplate spectrophotometer. Continuously monitor NADH oxidation to NAD+ as a decline in absorbance at 340 nm (A340), taking readings every 5-10 sec for up to 5 min (the samples need to shake while reading).\n3. Correct for background NADH oxidation by omitting PEP from the reaction mixture. Ensure that the decline in A340 (amount of NADH being oxidized; ε340 = 6,220/M/cm) is proportional to assay time and concentration of enzyme assayed. Dilution of clarified extract in extraction buffer may be necessary for samples containing abundant PEPCK activity.\nNote: One international unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme resulting in the production of 1 µmol of product per min at 25 °C.

Thus, if 3.0 μl of clarified extract mixed with 150 μl of PEPCK reaction mixture yields a ΔA340/min of 0.2 at 340 nm, then the PEPCK activity = (0.2 x 50)/6.22 U/ml = 1.6 U/ml.\n\nExtraction for measuring NADP-ME activity:\n1.

Measure NADP-ME activity immediately or the aliquots of clarified extracts can be snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80 °C for future use.\n\nNADP-ME activity measurement:\nThe activity of NADP-ME is based upon the reduction of NADP+ at 340 nm at 25 °C. Briefly, a continuous assay is used in which malate is oxidized to pyruvate and CO2, and NADP+ is reduced to NADPH. The reduction of NADP+ by NADP-ME is measured at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer.\n1. Accurately pipette 5-10 µl of clarified extract into a microplate well.\n2. Use a repeat pipettor to add 100 µl NADP-ME assay mix 1 to each well and immediately place in microplate spectrophotometer. Continuously monitor NADP+ reduction to NADPH as an increase in absorbance at 340 nm (A340), taking readings every 5-10 sec for up to 5 min (the samples need to shake while reading).\n3. Correct for background NADP+ reduction by omitting L-malate from the reaction mixture. Ensure that the increase in A340 is proportional to assay time and concentration of enzyme assayed. Dilution of clarified extract in extraction buffer may be necessary for samples containing abundant NADP-ME activity.\nNote: One international unit (U) of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 1 µmol of NADPH min-1 under the specified conditions.

Remove the brownish supernatant (stroma) by pipetting and store it in frozen at -20 °C for 30 min.\n12. Resuspend the pellet in 45% sucrose in TE buffer to a concentration of 2-3 mg chlorophyll/ml. Homogenize the pellet in a Potter homogenizer for 20 strokes as given above. The membranes may be stored at -20 °C at this point for later fractionation.\n13. Pipette the resuspended membranes into a polycarbonate UltraClear SW28 tube.\n14. Membranes were overlaid with a linear sucrose gradient created using 15 ml 5% sucrose and 15 ml of 45% sucrose in TE buffer and centrifuged for 17 h at 100,000 x g and 4 °C (SW41Ti rotor).\n15. Collect 1 ml of fractions from the gradient. The fractions can be stored at -20 °C. Starting from the top of the gradient (fraction 1) and ending at the bottom (approximately 32 fractions), plastoglobules are typically present in fractions 1-6; envelopes in fractions 14-18, and thylakoid membranes in fractions 25-32. Nevertheless, the exact chloroplast membrane distribution could be checked by immunoblotting with anti-PGL35 (for plastoglobules), anti-TOC75 (for envelopes), and anti-LHCB2 (for thylakoid membranes). For reference, Figure 1 illustrates the purification of plastoglobules by flotation centrifugation, where total membranes from isolated chloroplasts were separated by flotation on a continuous sucrose gradient. Plastoglobules are visible as a yellowish green layer at the top of the gradient. THY refers to thylakoid membranes; PG refers to plastoglobules.", "notes": "None"}

Wheel in a cold room\n2. Refrigerating centrifuge 1.5 ml tubes", "procedures": "1. Antibody affinity columns\n    a. Incubate 5 to 10 mg of the antibody (Ab) per 1 ml of wet washed protein G agarose beads for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rocking. The quantity of Ab and protein G agarose beads varies and depends on the affinity of the Ab (see note 1).\n    b. Wash the beads twice with 10 volumes of 0.2 M sodium borate (pH 9.0) by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 30 sec.\n    c. Resuspend the beads in 10 volumes of 0.2 M sodium borate (pH 9.0) and save 1% of the total beads volume (aliquot “before”). Add dimethylpimelimidate (solid) to a 20 mM concentration. The pH is critical and should be above 8.3 after adding the dimethylpimelimidate for efficient coupling and can be checked with pH strips indicator for example.\n    d. Mix for 30 min at room temperature on a rocker or shaker. Save 1% of the total beads volume (aliquot “after”).\n    e. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 3 min and discard the supernatant.\n    f. Stop the reaction by washing the beads once with equal volume of 0.2 M ethanolamine (pH 8.0). Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 3 min and discard the supernatant.\n    g. Repeat the 0.2 M ethanolamine wash one more time and incubate for 2 h at room temperature in with gentle mixing.\n    h. Wash beads with equal volume of PBS. Centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 3 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat the wash with PBS one more time, then store the beads in PBS with 0.01% merthiolate in the desired volume. The beads are stable for over 1 year if stored at 4 °C.\n    i. Check the efficiency of coupling by boiling samples of beads taken before and after coupling in Laemmli buffer. Run on 10% SDS PAGE and stain with Coomassie blue. Good coupling is indicated by heavy-chain bands (55 kDa) in the “before” but not in the “after” lanes. If there are small amounts of heavy chain, on the “after”, prewash the coupled beads with 100 mM glycine (pH 3.0) by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 30 sec to remove any residual antibodies that are not covalently bound to the beads. Then wash beads with PBS then store the beads in PBS with 0.01% merthiolate in the desired volume.\n\n2. Nuclear extract preparation\nWe used this protocol with ALL-SIL and DND41 cell lines derived from patient T cell lymphoblast.\n    a. Wash cells with cold 1x PBS then centrifuge for 6 min at 1,200 rpm at 4 °C. From now on, all the steps should be performed on ice.\n    b. Resuspend the cell pellet in the chilled Sucrose buffer (5 µl/1 x 10^6 cells).\n    c. Add vol/vol Sucrose buffer containing 0.5% NP40 (final concentration 0.25%).\n    d. Mix by pipetting on ice. Save a small aliquot (1 to 5% -aliquot 1).\n    e. Centrifuge 10 min at 1,100 x g at 4 °C. The pellet contains the nuclei and looks nacreous to white. The supernatant contains the cytoplasmic protein extract and can be saved if a cytoplasmic protein is of interest for Co-IP. Save a small aliquot (1 to 5% -aliquot 2).\n    f. Wash the pellet with Sucrose buffer (without NP40) and centrifuge 10 min at 2,000 rpm at 4 °C.\n    g. Depending on the nuclear proteins to be purified, you can lyse nuclei with: i. Either the Nuclear Lysis buffer for soluble proteins (5 µl/ 1 x 10^6 cells); ii. Or the Nuclei Lysis buffer for hard-to-extract proteins (5 µl/ 1 x 10^6 cells) and add DNase 5 U/µl and Benzonase 5 U/µl. Resuspension is hard since it’s very viscous with DNA.\n    h. Incubate on a wheel at 4 °C for 45 min to 1 h. Save a small aliquot (1 to 5% -aliquot 3).\n    i. Centrifuge 3 min at 10,000 x g at 4 °C. The supernatant is the protein nuclei extract that will serve for the IP. Save a small aliquot from the supernatant (1 to 5% -aliquot 4; which is also the input of the IP experiment) and the pellet is the insoluble substance such as membrane debris. Resuspend the pellet in 5 µl/ 1 x 10^6 cells of 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris. Save a small aliquot (1 to 5% -aliquot 5).\n    j. Verify the efficiency of the lysis by analyzing by SDS-PAGE and western-blot the presence of your proteins of interest in the saved aliquots: Aliquot 1: total cells; Aliquot 2: cytoplasm protein extract; Aliquot 3: total nuclei extract; Aliquot 4: nuclear protein extract; Aliquot 5: insoluble nuclei extract.\n\n3. Co-ImmunoPrecipitation\n    a. Incubate the protein nuclei extract with the Antibody-bound beads. (Ab concentration needs to be determined experimentally.) Optimization is required for efficient IP of your protein of interest and the quantity of Ab may vary according to the quality and affinity of the Ab, the protein G coupling, the protein stability, etc.\n    b. Incubate 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking.\n    c. Wash 4 to 6 times the beads in 100 mM NaCl, 15 mM Tris, HCl pH 7.8, by mixing by pipetting and centrifuging 10,000 x g for 30 sec at 4 °C.\n    d. Elute the bound proteins in Laemmli loading buffer and separate by SDS-PAGE and analyze by western blot.", "notes": "1. We used Protein G agarose beads with mouse IgG1 antibodies. However, the affinity of the isotype antibody of interest needs to be verified accordingly to the protein A or G manufacturer’s recommendations.   \n2. The quantity of the cells used for protein extract may vary according to the expression, the stability of the protein.   \n3. The Benzonase and DNase treatment is used only in case of hard to extract proteins that stick to the nuclei inclusion bodies/ nucleosome. If the proteins of interest are soluble, the use of the Nuclei Lysis buffer for soluble factors is preferred."}

After 2 to 3 h, collect all the feces.\n3. Store the feces to -20 °C fridge if not use immediately. The fecal pellets can be stored for one week.\n\nB. Isolating the total exosomes\n1. Weigh the feces, add to a clean 50-ml conical tube (1.0 gram of feces in each tube, roughly 50 to 75 fecal pellets.)\n2. Take another clean 50-ml conical tube, put five protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, add 50 ml ice-cold PBS, shake until the tablets are dissolved.\n3. Add 25 ml PBS solution prepared in Step B2 to the 50-ml conical tube (contains 1.0-gram feces.)\n4. Put the tube in the 4 °C fridge for 30 min.\n5.

Save the pellet (exosome pellet after ultracentrifugation).\n17. Resuspend the pellet in PBS (1 ml PBS per 1 g of feces sample).\n18. Store the suspension in the 4 °C fridge before characterization. Note: Store the samples at -80 °C if you do not test the sample in 2 days.\n\nC. Subfractionation of total exosome (sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation) to isolate colonic exosomes from microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles\n1. Make 8%, 30%, 45%, 60% (w/v) sucrose solution in double distilled water and filtrate the solution through 0.22 µm filter. Note: Filter all the 8%, 30%, 45%, 60% sucrose solutions through 0.22 μm membrane to remove small particles before sample loading, as small particles will contaminate the exosomes when doing ultracentrifugation.\n2. Load the centrifuge tubes (14 x 89 mm) with sucrose solution, from 60% to 8%, with 1.5 ml of 60%, 1.5 ml of 45%, 1.5 ml of 30%, 1 ml of 8%, then 4.5 ml of PBS (this describes the setting up of the sucrose gradient).\n3.

Particle size measurement: Take 0.5 ml exosome solution, dilute with 2.0 ml PBS, pipette into a cuvette (avoid generating bubbles), insert cuvette to the chamber of particle size analyzer. Read the size of the particles by the 90 Plus Particle Sizing Software. The average size of the hydrated exosome is about 155 nm (152.8 to 157.9 nm in this test) in diameter (this describes the particle size measurement of the hydrated fecal exosome).\n2. Particle surface zeta potential measurement: Take a 0.8 ml diluted solution (prepared for particle size measurement in Step D1), slowly pipette into a disposable capillary cell, cover the cell, insert the cell to the chamber of zeta analyzer, and record the value. The Z-potential of the sample is about -11.2 mV (-10.2 to -12.2 mv in this test) at neutral pH (software: Malvern Zetasizer).

Wait for 15 min at room temperature.\n7. Read the absorbance at 750 nm by a microplate reader.\n8. Draw the standard curve and calculate the protein concentration. Note: Expected protein concentration is between 0.25 to 1.5 mg/ml for exosomes isolated from 1g of feces as starting material. If the concentration is beyond the linear range (0.25 to 1.5 mg/ml), dilute or concentrate the sample and redo the test.\n\nF. CD-63 protein detection (Western Blotting method)\n1. Add 100 μl RIPA buffer (10x) to 900 μl icy cold PBS (containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) to make a 1 ml solution A.\n2. Take 20 μg fecal nanovesicles (20 μl from 1 mg/ml solution), add 100 μl icy cold solution A.\n3. Sonicate the sample for 3 times at 42 kHz, room temperature, 10-15 s each time.\n4. Spin at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.\n5. Take the supernatant, add the same volume of Laemmli buffer (2x).\n6. Boil the samples at 95 °C for 5 min.\n7. Centrifuge at 16,000 x g in a microcentrifuge for 1 min.\n8. Load the sample on 4-20% pre-casted gel.\n9. Add running buffer (Recipe 1), run the gel for 5 min at 50 v.\n10. Increase the voltage to 100 v, run the gel for 1 h.\n11. Take out the gel, add transfer buffer (Recipe 2), adjust the voltage to 100 v, and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Chankova et al., 2013).\n12. Take out the nitrocellulose membrane, block with 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h.\n13. Add primary antibody (Anti-CD63 1:200 dilution in PBS, and Anti-beta-actin, 1:200 dilution in PBS), incubate for 2 h at room temperature.\n14. Wash 3-5 times with PBS for 5 mins, add the secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.\n15. Detect the chemiluminescence bands with ECL Plus reagent. A representative western blotting picture is shown (Western blot band of CD63, using lysed mouse large intestine sample as control).\n\nG. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\n1. Pipette 1 μg (1 μl of 1mg/ml) fecal exosome solution in 10 μl distilled water.\n2. Deposit 5 to 10 μl sample onto the surface of Formvar®-coated copper grids.\n3. Add 5 μl 1% uranyl acetate (Recipe 3) for 15 s.\n4. Dry the sample at room temperature for at least 30 mins.\n5. Test the sample by the transmission electron microscopy. A representative TEM picture of the fecal exosome is shown (TEM graph of the isolated fecal exosome).\n\nH. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)\n1. Pipette 0.25 μg (0.5 μl of 0.5 mg/ml) fecal exosome solution in 10 μl PBS.\n2. Deposit the 5 to 10 μl sample onto a mica sheet.\n3. Dry the sample at room temperature for about 2 h.\n4. Add 20 μl distilled water to the mica sheet.\n5. Dry the sample at room temperature for another 2 h.\n6. Wait until the sample is relatively flat.\n7. Scan the sample with an area about 4 x 4 μm or a smaller area with 2-50 nm in height. A typical AFM graph of the fecal exosome is shown (AFM graph of the isolated fecal exosome).\n\nData analysis:\nThis section describes typical data analysis for the exosome sample’s protein concentration test; quantification is based on the standard curve of BSA samples; this is as described in “Section E. Protein concentration”.\n1. Subtract the averaged blank PBS value from the standards values, (or select the “subtract blank value function” in the plate reader’s software and take the value directly).\n2. Take the average value of adjusted standards and make a regression equation in Microsoft Excel, calculate the correlation coefficient (R or R square), make sure the correlation coefficient is above 0.95. This process generates a standard curve and regression equation for DCTM protein concentration test.\n3. Adjust the exosome sample’s value by subtracting the averaged exosome blank’s (PBS) value. Take the average of the adjusted exosome sample’s values, and substitute into the regression equation as “y” (OD 750), calculate the value of “x”, which is the protein concentration.\n4. Last, normalize the protein concentration as “mg per gram of feces” by multiplying the dilution factor. (2 x dilution means 1 g of feces in 2 ml PBS, 0.5x dilution means 1 g of feces in 0.5 ml PBS).\n\nTable: Protein mg/mL vs OD 750 value (Average)\n- 0.25 mg/mL: 0.0545\n- 0.5 mg/mL: 0.103\n- 0.75 mg/mL: 0.1475\n- 1 mg/mL: 0.19\n- 1.25 mg/mL: 0.234\n- 1.5 mg/mL: 0.26\n\nTable: Detailed Protein Quantitation Data for Fecal Exosome Samples\nStandards (BSA) Concentration (mg/ml):\n- 0.25: Standards 1 (0.115), Standards 2 (0.125), Blank (PBS) (0.065), Blank (Average) (0.066), Standards 1 minus Blank (0.050), Standards 2 minus Blank (0.059), Standards minus Blank (Average) (0.055)\n- 0.5: Standards 1 (0.166), Standards 2 (0.171), Blank (PBS) (0.066), Standards 1 minus Blank (0.101), Standards 2 minus Blank (0.105), Standards minus Blank (Average) (0.103)\n- 0.75: Standards 1 (0.208), Standards 2 (0.219), Blank (PBS) (0.067), Standards 1 minus Blank (0.142), Standards 2 minus Blank (0.153), Standards minus Blank (Average) (0.148)\n- 1.0: Standards 1 (0.257), Standards 2 (0.254), Blank (PBS) (0.067), Standards 1 minus Blank (0.191), Standards 2 minus Blank (0.189), Standards minus Blank (Average) (0.190)\n- 1.25: Standards 1 (0.297), Standards 2 (0.303), Blank (PBS) (0.065), Standards 1 minus Blank (0.231), Standards 2 minus Blank (0.237), Standards minus Blank (Average) (0.234)\n- 1.5: Standards 1 (0.328), Standards 2 (0.324), Blank (PBS) (0.065), Standards 1 minus Blank (0.262), Standards 2 minus Blank (0.258), Standards minus Blank (Average) (0.260)\n\nStandard curve: Y = 0.1672x + 0.0185 (R2 = 0.9937)\n\nExosome Blank*: 0.072, 0.076 (Average Blank is not explicitly stated for exosome blank, but implied from context)\n\nExosome sample 1:\n- OD750 value: 0.219, 0.223, 0.212\n- Sample 1 minus Blank: 0.145, 0.149, 0.138\n- Sample 1 concentration: 0.750 mg/ml\n- Normalized concentration (2x dilution): 1.500 mg/g\n\nExosome sample 2:\n- OD750 value: 0.188\n- Sample 2 minus Blank: 0.114\n- Sample 2 concentration: 0.630 mg/ml\n- Normalized concentration (2x dilution): 1.260 mg/g\n\nExosome sample 3:\n- OD750 value: 0.178\n- Sample 3 minus Blank: 0.104\n- Sample 3 concentration: 0.510 mg/ml\n- Normalized concentration (0.5x dilution): 0.26 mg/g", "notes": "1.

Positively charged semen amyloids capture negatively charged viral particles and increase their attachment rates to the cell surface resulting in enhanced fusion and infection (Roan et al., 2009). Since semen is highly cytotoxic, we developed an assay that allows quantification of the infection enhancing activity of semen while minimizing its cell damaging activity. Here, we describe two protocols that allow the quantification of the infectivity enhancing activity of semen using a reporter cell line (TZM-bl cells) or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).", "materials": "1.

Do not add DEAE-Dextran, polybrene, or other additives that are often used in TZM-bl assays to increase infection rates. Addition of separate enhancers will mask the infection enhancing activity of semen.   \n2. Use low MOIs that are either sub-infectious in the absence of semen or result in infection rates of less than 10%. Only then, an enhancing effect of semen on viral infection can be determined. Furthermore, a low MOI resembles physiological HIV-1 concentrations during sexual transmission.   \n3. The HIV-1 enhancing activity of semen decreases over time. Thus, semen needs to be handled quickly.   \n4. Pre-exposure of virus to semen allows binding of seminal amyloids to viral particles as it likely also occurs in vivo.   \n5. Semen, after collection, is often not sterile thus gentamicin needs to be added to avoid bacterial outgrowth.   \n6. Even low semen concentrations (starting from 1% on cells) are cytotoxic. Therefore, semen concentrations need to be reduced and the exposure time shortened (e.g., by media change). 7. In parallel, it is recommended to run cytotoxicity assays. [e.g., MTT assay (see Kim et al., 2010) or Luminescent Cell Viability Assay]   \n8. Assay does not need to be performed in flat 96-well plates, but can also be scaled into different formats.   \nIf these points are considered, the experimental set up can be adapted and modified to allow measurement of infection of different target cells with any HIV strain and reporter virus (i.e., GFP followed by a flow cytometry readout), as well as other viruses such as HCMV and HSV (Tang et al., 2013; Torres et al., 2015).   \nInfection enhancement by in vitro generated amyloid fibrils can be examined using the same protocol, except that the toxicity avoiding steps, i.e., addition of gentamicin, high volumes of medium, removal of toxic semen after 2-3 h can be omitted."}

SUMO and enzymes of the SUMO pathway are well conserved from yeast to humans and SUMO modification regulates a variety of essential cellular processes including transcription, chromatin remodeling, DNA damage repair, and cell cycle progression. One of the challenges in studying SUMO modification in vivo is the relatively low steady-state level of a SUMO-modified protein due in part to the activity of SUMO deconjugating enzymes known as SUMO Isopeptidases or SENPs.

Methods for protein expression and purification have been described elsewhere (Yang et al., 2018).\n\nC. In vitro transcription/translation of protein of interest\n1. Remove a tube of rabbit reticulocyte from the kit stored at -80 °C and thaw on ice.\n2. For each substrate, add 20 μl of rabbit reticulocyte to an Eppendorf tube on ice.\n3.

Run SDS-PAGE at 70 V, room temperature, for approximately 20 min, or until the bottom dye indicator reaches just below the stacking gel and in the running gel. Run at 120 V, room temperature, for an additional 2 h. Stop electrophoresis before the 10 kDa molecular weight marker reaches the bottom of the gel (or until the bottom dye indicator just reaches the bottom of the gel).\n4. Gently separate gel plates using a spatula. Gently slide surgical blade along sides of the glass plate to release gel and remove the stacking gel away from the running gel with blade and discard.\n5. Carefully remove the gel and place in a small dish or plastic container (a pipet tip box lid is suitable) pre-filled with destaining buffer at room temperature.\n6. Wash with gentle shaking for 10 min, at room temperature.\n7. Carefully discard destaining buffer (free [35S]-Methionine may be in the solution, so pour in a radiation waste container).\n8. Add MilliQ water and wash with gently shaking for 10 min, at room temperature. Repeat at least 3 times (see Notes).\n\nF. Autoradiography\n1.

Carefully close the cassette. Do not bring into contact with light.\n10. Keep the cassette in a dark area overnight at room temperature.\n11. Develop the exposed film according to manufacturer’s instructions. (See Notes for additional information).\n\nData analysis\n1. Overlay developed film over dried gel and use molecular weight markers to demarcate molecular weights using a permanent pen.\n2. Locate the unmodified protein of interest and any shifts in molecular weight (~12 kDa shift represents modification by a single SUMO, 24 kDa shift represents modification by two SUMOs, etc.). It is possible for several SUMO consensus sites to be present in the protein of interest, and several SUMO-modified bands may be represented.\n3. If amino acid substitutions have been made to SUMO consensus site lysines, high molecular weight band shifts should decrease in number until a complete SUMO mutant is generated.\n\nFigure 2. In vitro SUMO2 modification of APC4. APC4 is a 808 amino acid protein with two consensus SUMO sites at K772 and K798 (A). Full-length wild-type APC4 (B) or the indicated lysine to alanine substitution mutants (C, D, E) were expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]-Methionine and incubated for the indicated times in modification reactions containing SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes and SUMO2. Proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Asterisks indicate sumoylated forms of APC4.", "notes": "A. Identification of SUMO modification consensus sites and SUMO mutant generation GPS SUMO is a web-based tool (Zhao et al., 2014) that identifies potential SUMO conjugation sites or SIM Motifs (Yunus and Lima, 2009). Input of the amino acid sequence in FASTA format is used.   \nB. Preparation of SUMO enzymes from E. coli Depending on whether the protein of interest is modified by SUMO1 or SUMO2/3, the appropriate recombinant protein should be used in the assay. If unknown, it is recommended that modification by both SUMO1 and SUMO2/3 be tested. Of note, SUMO2/3 can generate polymeric chains due to a SUMO consensus site at K11 in both SUMO2 and SUMO3.\n\nIn human cells, the SUMO E1 enzyme is expressed as a heterodimer Aos1/Uba2. Co-expression and purification of these two proteins can be prepared in batch. The conjugating enzyme, Ubc9, is used in relatively high concentrations and may circumvent the requirement of an E3 ligating enzyme. Caution should be used, however, in possible misinterpretation of results and the possibility that E3’s may be critical for site-selective modification. It is also possible for some substrates to require an E3 ligase (such as the PIAS family of proteins [Zhu et al., 2008]) for efficient SUMO modification in vitro.\n\n# C. In vitro SUMO Modification–time-course analysis\n\nIn general, the time required for SUMO modification at 30 °C must be determined empirically, as the concentrations of SUMO enzymes in addition to increases in temperature (up to 37 °C) can change the efficiency of conjugation. Generally, with this protocol, SUMO substrates are modified within one hour. However, a time-course is recommended for each protein of interest, as some proteins are more readily SUMO-modified than others. Substrate recognition by SUMO conjugating enzymes or properties inherent in the SUMO protein itself can affect the kinetics of modification. For example, the presence of SUMO Interacting Motifs (SIMs) in the substrate protein can enhance SUMO modification. SIMs are composed of hydrophobic amino acids (V/I)-x-(V/I)-(V/I) flanked by an acidic residue. The hydrophobic amino acids in SIMs interact non-covalently with a hydrophobic pocket situated in the β2 strand on the surface of SUMO, creating a parallel or antiparallel β-strand conformation. SIM Motifs can also be identified through GPS SUMO (Zhao et al., 2014).\n\n# D. In vitro SUMO Modification–enzyme concentrations\n\nThe concentrations of enzymes used can also be empirically adjusted. For example, BLM and APC4 are readily SUMO-modified with the concentrations of SUMO enzymes described above, but RanGAP1 is more efficiently SUMO-modified and therefore requires a lower concentration of conjugation enzymes and shorter incubation periods to achieve complete modification. For example, 15 mM E1, 45 nM E2, and 0.5 μM SUMO proteins are required for complete SUMO modification of RanGAP1 within 5-10 min of incubation at 30 °C.\n\nE. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis It is critical to sufficiently wash the gel following destaining. The presence of destaining solution can cause the gel to crack during drying.\n\nA 12.5% gel is recommended because free SUMO is a relatively small protein and this composition has proven to resolve proteins well in our experiments. A 4-15% gradient gel can also be used.\n\n# F. Autoradiography\n\nTime for gel drying can vary. Monitor carefully to sufficiently dry the gel but taking care not to overdry and generate cracks.\n\nG. Positive and negative controls\n\nAs a positive control for SUMO modification, recombinant RanGAP1 can be used. RanGAP1 is a labile SUMO substrate and can be modified efficiently at room temperature. Concentrations of SUMO conjugating enzymes should be adjusted (15 mM E1, 45 nM E2, 0.5 μm SUMO1), as this protein is modified rapidly. Plasmids for expression in E. coli for protein purification (Werner et al., 2009) are available through Addgene (Plasmid #13379) or recombinant GST-RanGAP1 is commercially available (can be purchased from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc.) Lysine to arginine substitutions can be made as mutations on the substrate of interest to prevent SUMO conjugation. For example, one possible negative control is RanGAP1 with K526R cannot be modified by SUMO (Mahajan et al., 1998). Reactions without ATP or the SUMO E1 enzyme can also be utilized as negative controls for the reaction."}

The range of [3H]gaboxadol concentrations will be determined based on the literature and previous experiments. The highest concentration will then be used to calculate a theoretical “Shoot for”. For example, if the highest concentration used in the experiment is 400 nM of [3H]gaboxadol, the total volume added to the slide mailer is 7 ml. The volume of the 10X stock displacer solution to be added to the mailer is 0.7 ml; therefore, 6.3 ml of X concentration of the “Shoot for” will be needed. Thus, the “Shoot for” will be calculated as: X = (400 nM\\*7ml)/6.3 ml, and X = 444.44 nM.\n        ii. Volume (V) of the original [3H]gaboxadol required to make the theoretical “Shoot for”: SA is the radioactive ligand’s specific activity (Ci/mmol) provided by the manufacturer. In addition, the specific activity for the same ligand may vary between production batches; X is the theoretical concentration of the “Shoot for” (nM); Vt is the total volume of “Shoot for” needed to make the series dilution (L). Therefore, Vt = V1+V2+……+VHighest. For each concentration, there will be a “total” mailer (measuring total binding, displacer omitted) and a “blank” mailer (measuring non-specific binding, displacer added). For example, a series of concentrations of 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250 and 400 nM [3H]gaboxadol are used and the total volume of the “Shoot for”: Vt (L) = [(5 nM\\*7 ml/X)+(10 nM\\*7 ml/X)… +(400 nM\\*7 ml/X)]\\*2 / 1000.\n        iii. The “Shoot for” solution will be made by adding V (µl) of the original [3H]gaboxadol to Vt-V amount of the incubation buffer.\n    b. Count “Shoot for” using Scintillation counter by aliquoting 10 µl of “shoot for” into 5 ml of scintillation fluid. Based on the counts, calculate the actual concentration of the “Shoot for” using GraphPad Radioactive Calculator. If the measured value is close to the theoretical concentration, continue to the next step. From this point forward, the actual concentration of the stock solution will be used for the dilution calculations.\n    c. Pipette required amount of 50 mM Tris-Citrate buffer to tubes labeled with Total or Blank of 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250 and 400 nM of [3H]gaboxadol, add appropriate volume of the stock solution to make to the designated concentrations.\n    d. Add 0.7 ml of 200 µM GABA into tubes labeled Blank.\n    e. Count the counts of the mixture in 16 tubes. The actual concentration of [3H]gaboxadol in each tube will be calculated based on these counts.\n7. Transfer mixtures from 16 tubes into the correctly labeled slide mailer.\n8. Drop slides into their designated mailers. Shake well, before leaving mailers in the refrigerator for 1 h at 4 °C.\n9. After incubation, slides will be washed twice in cold Tris-Citrate buffer for 10+10 sec, followed by cold dH2O for 10 sec.\n10. Let slides dry for 2-4 h or overnight.\n11. Break the slides: re-label the slides next to the sections, line up sections with a ruler and cut the slides using a diamond scribe. The slide end (with one section on it) will be taped using double-sided tape after being broken.\n12. Put the slides onto the phosphor transcreens; transcreen exposure time is about 48 h.\n13. Binding images are obtained by scanning the exposed phosphor transcreens using a Cyclone Phosphor Imager. An autoradiographic image of [3H]gaboxadol on GABAA receptor binding in a four month old Fischer Brown Norway rat brain tissue (16 µm thickness) is shown. Highest binding area (circled) is the medial geniculate body, while hippocampus and cortex show moderate binding.", "notes": "None"}

For optimal results, use the most diluted cellular suspension possible. Typically, total cells are prepared at 2 x 10^7 total cells/ml medium. Since any given cell source will have unique purification requirements, it is recommended to determine the optimal condition by individual user.\n   b. QIAGEN suggests using 10-50 magnetic particles per cell (total cell population). However it has been proved that as few as 2-3 magnetic particles per total thymocytes works very efficiently. 1 mg/ml BioMag suspension contains 1 x 10^8 magnetic particles per milligram, which is equivalent to 1 x 10^8 magnetic particles per milliliter.

{"exp_name": "In vitro Cleavage and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays for Very Fast CRISPR", "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 has transformed biomedical research and medicine through convenient and targeted manipulation of DNA. Time- and spatially-resolved control over Cas9 activity through the recently developed very fast CRISPR (vfCRISPR) system have facilitated comprehensive studies of DNA damage and repair. Understanding the fundamental principles of Cas9 binding and cleavage behavior is essential before the widespread use of these systems and can be readily accomplished in vitro through both cleavage and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). The protocol for in vitro cleavage consists of Cas9 with guide RNA (gRNA) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation, followed by incubation with target DNA. For EMSA, this reaction is directly loaded onto an agarose gel for visualization of the target DNA band that is shifted due to binding by the Cas9 RNP. To assay for cleavage, Proteinase K is added to degrade the RNP, allowing target DNA (cleaved and/or uncleaved) to migrate consistently with its molecular weight. Heating at 95°C rapidly inactivates the RNP on demand, allowing time-resolved measurements of Cas9 cleavage kinetics. This protocol facilitates the characterization of the light-activation mechanism of photocaged vfCRISPR gRNA.", "materials": "1. 10 mg/ml SpCas9 (purified in-house from BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells [Agilent 230245], but can also be purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies) (Alt-R®, catalog number: 1081058, storage temperature: -80°C)\n2. tracrRNA (Integrated DNA Technologies) (Alt-R®, catalog number: 1072533, storage temperature: -80°C)\n3.

Maize varieties (that may have different lengths of developmental switch) (e.g. cv Early Golden Bantam or cv Gaspe Flint, or your maize cultivar of choice) are grown in round pots of 20 cm with 4 seeds in each pot at equal spacing. The pots are kept in a temperature controlled greenhouse with the following conditions (14-h/10-h light/dark cycle, 28/22 °C). Depending on the growth behavior of the plants, it must be ensured that the right stage is used for infection. Seedling infections are regularly done at the three leaf stage. Tassel infections are done when the tassel floral meristem is in the mitotic phase before the pollen formation (tassel size of 1-1.5 cm).\n2. Both varieties can be grown in soil in approximately 15 cm round pots with 4 plants each. The variety Gaspe Flint can mainly be used for tassel (male inflorescence) infections as they have an early floral switch (15 days) as compared to the standard maize (early golden Bantam which is approx. 4 weeks).\n\nB. U. maydis culture preparation\n1. U. maydis strains growing on a fresh PDA plate (no older than 1 week) are used for preparation of pre-inoculum. The strains are inoculated in a 3 ml YEPSL medium in a sterile glass test tube and incubated overnight at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm.\n2. The pre-inoculum (40 µl) is used for inoculation of the large media (50 ml) in a 250 ml sterile Erlenmeyer flask and then incubated at 28 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for around 10-12 h.\n3. The cultures are then harvested when the optical density (OD600) reaches to 0.6 to 0.8 (cultures should not be below 0.5, nor above 1.0). This range of OD ensures the growth of the U. maydis sporidia in the active dividing phase. The cultures are then centrifuged in 50 ml Falcon tubes at 900 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\n4. The harvested cells are resuspended and washed in sterile water to remove all the media remains. The step B4 of centrifugation is repeated.\n5. The cells are then resuspended by pipetting or vortexing in water to OD600 = 1.0. This inoculum is used to infect the maize plants.\nNote: For infection with wild type U. maydis strains (e.g., FB1 and FB2 which are the two compatible mating types) are to be mixed together in equal volume at OD600 =1.0 for a successful infection. In case of the solopathogenic strain SG200 (Kämper et al., 2006) or in case of any mutant resulting from this background one cultural strain can be used as inoculum.\n\nC. U. maydis virulence assays\nIn seedlings:\n1. Seedling infections are done with the maize plantlets that normally show three juvenile leaf stage. For most of the cultivars of maize, the plants are 7 days old when this developmental stage is reached. (Figure 1 illustrates maize plants cv. Early Golden Bantam and their inoculation with U. maydis, showing a maize seedling at the three leaf stage inoculated for seedling leaf infection, with the syringe pointing into the center of the leaf whirl.)\n2. The seeding infections are carried out by syringe with 300-500 μl of the inoculum cell suspension into the interior of the leaf whorl. The injection site is chosen approx. 1 cm above the soil, which is about 2.5 to 3 cm above the basal plant meristem and is the juvenile stem.\n3. The leaf sheaths of the first and second leaf and the leaf blades of the third and fourth leaf which are immersed into the whorl are pierced by the syringe half way onto the center of the stem cylinder, which later show an infection mark after the symptom development.\n4. Once the inoculum is seen on the inner whorl of leaves the seedling is known to be successfully infected.\n5. Plants are kept in controlled growth conditions at 28/22 °C. Successful infection will lead to tumor appearance after 4-6 dpi.\n6. The tumors formed by the artificial inoculation of seedlings are scored at 12 dpi by a modified standard scheme as described previously (Kämper et al., 2006) which is shown in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 2 (showing morphological symptoms in seedling and tassel tissues of maize after infection by U. maydis, with photographs taken at 10 dpi).\nTable 1, Classification of symptoms of infected maize seedlings:\n*   No symptom: The plant shows no signs of infection.\n*   Chlorosis: The plant shows chlorotic discolouration of the infected leaves (third leaf and younger).\n*   Small tumors: The largest tumors of the plant are <1.5 mm.\n*   Normal tumors: Tumors of the plant are 2-4 mm in diameter.\n*   Heavy Tumors: Very strong tumors leading to a stunted growth of stem.\n*   Dead Plant: The plant is dead and looks necrotic after infection with U. maydis.\n\nIn tassels (male inflorescence):\n1. Tassel infections are done immediately after floral switch of the plant when the tassel is still in the actively dividing mitotic phase. In cv. Gaspe Flint this is normally after 15 days and after around 4 weeks in cv. Early Golden Bantam after sowing. (Figure 1 also illustrates how a maize plant is inoculated for tassel infection, with the syringe hitting the tassel inside the stem, including an inset of the maize tassel at the stage of fungal infection.)\n2. The tassel infections are also performed using a syringe based method. The immature tassels location is identified without cutting the plant by pressing the stem. The tassel meristem embedded in the stem has an air space surrounding it which makes the stem hollower. Above the tassel which terminates the shoot, the leaf sheaths overlap, but there is no solid center and this region contains the developing inflorescence.\n3. Prior to injection, one or two plants are cut open with a sharp knife from the base, to understand the position of the tassel meristem that is embedded in the whorl of leaves.\n4. Based on this height, the tassel location is approximately identified on all plants. The standard injection protocol involves inoculation of 1 ml of culture injected all at once, taking care to penetrate only halfway across the plant diameter. This ensures the inoculum to the entire floral meristem and fills the air space around the tassel.\n5. Plants are kept in a controlled greenhouse at 28 °C which show successful tumor appearance after 8-10 dpi (as also illustrated in Figure 2, showing morphological symptoms in seedling and tassel tissues of maize after infection by U. maydis, with photographs taken at 10 dpi).\n6. Disease symptoms in the tassels are scored 10 days after infection in cv. Gaspe Flint and after 14 days in cv. Early Golden Bantam by the scoring scheme described previously (Schilling et al., 2014, Table 2).\nTable 2, Classification of symptoms of infected maize tassels:\n*   Tumors <50% of tassel, small: The part of the tassel is converted into small tumors in range of 2-4 mm.\n*   Tumors <50% of tassel, large: Less than half of the tassel is converted into large tumors >4 mm.\n*   Tumors >50% of tassel, small: The entire tassel inflorescence is covered with small tumors.\n*   Tumors >50% of tassel, large: The complete tassel is converted into heavy tumors by U. maydis.\n*   Tassel growth stunted: The tassel is arrested at the developmental time point at which it was infected and this 1-3 cm stunted tassel becomes tumorous.", "notes": "None"}

Procedures for cell extraction from 10 cm dish (2 dishes for each sample)\n1. Layer 360 µl of each gradient solution (30%, 23%, 17%, 11%, and 5% OptiPrep) in the Centrifuge tube(s) with P200 micropipette. Figure 1 illustrates the way to layer the gradient solution using P200 micropipette. Pour 360 µl of each gradient solution carefully into a centrifuge tube using P200 micropipette (180 µl x 2 times), not to make bubbles nor disturb the other layers. Layer in a centrifuge tube from the heaviest (30%) to lightest (5%) solution.\n2. Leave tubes at 4 °C for more than one hour and keep it still until use.\n3. Confirm that cells (e.g. RAW264.7, or Raji) are healthy and 75-80% confluent under a microscopy.\n4. (Optional) Treat with stimulants for the desired period (e.g. LPS at 100 ng/ml for 30 min).\n5. Wash twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, transfer to suitable tubes, and determine cell density and viability with a hemacytometer and trypan blue staining.\n6. Transfer 1.5 ~ 2.0 x 10^7 cells to new tubes and centrifuge at 1,100 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.\n7. Aspirate the supernatant, tap tubes to loosen cells, and add 450 µl of ice-cold Solution E per tube.\n8. Homogenize cells by 80-100 passages through a 29-gauge needle until cells show roughly 70-80% trypan blue positive. Cells should be kept cold.\n9. Centrifuge the homogenate at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and transfer the whole supernatant (the post-nuclear fraction) to new 1.5 ml tubes and centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C again. Repeat this step until pellet of cell debris can not be seen after centrifugation (usually 3 times). Note: The whole supernatant should be taken for the second centrifugation, and the same for the third centrifugation. Initial volume of supernatant after centrifugation should be roughly 400 µl, and after 2 times centrifugation it will be reduced to ca. 350 µl.\n10. Carefully layer 300 µl of the supernatant on the top of the gradient solution made in step A1.\n11. Set the centrifuge tubes in the chilled ultracentrifuge rotor TLS-55.\n12. Centrifuge for 4 h at 39,000 rpm (130,000 x g) at 4 °C by Optima MAX-TL. Note: Set acceleration (Accel) and deceleration (Decel) at 8 and 0 (free deceleration), respectively.\n13. Harvest 185 µl per one fraction to make 11 fractions using P200 micropipette, and transfer to 1.5 ml microtubes.\n14. Store at -80 °C until use.\n\nB. Procedures for mouse naïve B cells\n1. Layer 360 µl of each gradient solution (30%, 23%, 17%, 11%, and 5% OptiPrep) in the Centrifuge tube(s) with P200 micropipette.\n2. Leave tubes at 4 °C for more than one hour and keep it still until use. Separate the naïve splenic B cells by using CD43-microbeads and MACS according to the manufacturer’s instruction (please see the following link: http://www.miltenyibiotec.co.jp/\\~/media/Images/Products/Import/0001200/IM0001263.ashx).\n3. (Optional) Treat 1.5 ~ 2.0 x 10^8 of B cells with stimulants for the desired period (e.g. CpG-1668 at 100 nM for 1 h).\n4. Wash twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS in suitable tubes, and determine cell density and viability with a hemocytometer and trypan blue staining.\n5. Transfer the cells to new tubes and centrifuge at 1,100 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C.\n6. Aspirate the supernatant, tap tubes to loosen cells, and add 450 µl of ice-cold Solution E per tube.\n7. Homogenize cells by passing roughly 200 times through a 29-gauge needle until cells show 70-80% trypan blue positive. Cells should be kept cold on ice.\n8. Centrifuge the homogenate at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and transfer the supernatant (the post-nuclear fraction) to new 1.5 ml tubes. Repeat this step three times.\n9. Carefully layer 300 µl of the supernatant on the top of the gradient.\n10. Set the tubes in the chilled ultracentrifuge rotor TLS-55.\n11. Centrifuge for 4 h at 39,000 rpm (130,000 x g) at 4 °C by Optima MAX-TL. Note: Set acceleration (Accel) and deceleration (Decel) at 8 and 0 (free deceleration), respectively.\n12. Harvest 290 µl per one fraction to make 7 fractions using P200 micropipette, and transfer to 1.5 ml microtubes.\n13. Store at -80 °C until use.\n\nC. Evaluation of the fractionation\n1. Take 30 µl of the fractions and mix with the equal volume of 2x SDS-PAGE sample buffer.\n2. After brief denaturing at 95 °C, apply 15 µl of the samples to run SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane.\n3. Block the blot with Blocking One, followed by incubation with the primary antibodies against organelle markers. Following antibodies used in this protocol: anti-LAMP1 (dilution 1:1,000) for the detection of the late endosome/lysosome, anti-GM130 for cis-Golgi, anti-Rab5 for endosome, anti-Calnexin for ER, and anti-COX IV for mitochondria, respectively.\n4. Wash the blots 3 times with TBS-T to remove excess antibodies (5 min x 3 times).\n5. Incubate with the proper secondary antibodies conjugated with HRP for 1 h [Anti-rat Ig (H+L) for anti-LAMP1, anti-mouse Ig (H+L) for anti-GM130 or anti-Rab5, anti-rabbit Ig (H+L) for anti-Calnexin or COX IV, respectively. Concentration of secondary antibodies is roughly at 50 ng/ml].\n6. Wash the blots with TBS-T to remove excess antibodies (15 min x 3 times).\n7. Incubate with ECL substrate, and detect the luminescence signals. Figure 2 shows that intracellular vesicles of mouse naïve B cells were fractionated and their distribution was analyzed by western blotting with the specific antibodies against the following organelle markers: late endosome/lysosome with LAMP1, cis-Golgi with GM130, pan-endosome with Rab5, ER with Calnexin, and mitochondria with COX IV, respectively.", "notes": "1. For homogenization of cells, Dounce homogenizer or other devices can be used, as the degree of homogenization difficulty depends on the cell types.   \n2. For small cells such as mouse naïve B cells, number of passage with 29G syringe may differ depending on the cell density."}
