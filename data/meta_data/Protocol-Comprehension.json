    "title": "Rapid Method for Estimating Polyhydroxybutyrate Accumulation in Bacteria Using Sodium Hypochlorite",
    "abstract": "This protocol outlines the use of the previously described sodium hypochlorite extraction method for estimating the accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) in bacteria. Sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) is widely used for PHB extraction as it oxidizes most components of the cells except PHB. We assessed the feasibility of using NaClO extraction for the estimation of PHB accumulation in bacterial cells (expressed as a percentage w/w). This allowed us to use a simple spectrophotometric measurement of the turbidity of the PHB extracted by NaClO as a semiquantitative estimation of PHB accumulation in the marine microorganisms Halomonas titanicae KHS3, Alteromonas sp., and Cobetia sp. However, this fast and easy protocol could be used for any bacterial species as long as some details are considered. This estimation exhibited a good correlation with the accumulation measured as dry cell weight or even with the accumulation measured by crotonic acid and HPLC quantifications. The key advantage of this protocol is how fast it allows an estimation of PHB accumulation in Halomonas, Alteromonas, and Cobetia cultures (results are available in 50 min ), enabling the identification of the appropriate moment to harvest cells for further extraction, polymer characterization, and accurate quantification using more reliable and time-consuming methods. This protocol is very useful during bacterial cultivation for a quick evaluation of PHA accumulation without requiring (i) large volumes of cultures, (ii) a long time for analysis compared to dry cell weight, (iii) preparation of standard curves with sulfuric acid hydrolysis for crotonic acid quantification, or (iv) specific equipment and/or technical services for HPLC quantification.",
    "problem": "Traditional methods for estimating polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation in bacteria are time-consuming, require specialized equipment, and involve complex procedures, making it challenging to monitor PHB production efficiently during bacterial cultivation.",
    "method": "The protocol employs sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) to selectively oxidize cellular components, leaving PHB intact, and uses spectrophotometric measurement of PHB turbidity for semi-quantitative estimation.",
    "innovation": "The method is rapid (results in 50 minutes), requires minimal sample volume, eliminates the need for specialized equipment or standard curve preparation, and exhibits good correlation with established quantification methods like dry cell weight and HPLC.",
    "application": "Initially validated for marine bacteria (Halomonas, Alteromonas, and Cobetia), the protocol is adaptable to other bacterial species and is particularly useful for quick PHB accumulation monitoring during cultivation, aiding in determining optimal harvest times.",

    "title": "Mouse Model of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Induced Pulpitis",
    "abstract": "Pulpitis is an important and prevalent disease within the oral cavity. Thus, animal models are necessary tools for basic research focused on pulpitis. Researchers worldwide often use dogs and miniature pigs to construct animal models of pulpitis. However, gene editing in miniature pigs is difficult, the surgical modeling process is complex, and tooth demineralization time is lengthy. Although some researchers have attempted to establish a mouse model of pulpitis, most models have involved direct exposure of dental pulp. However, the causes of pulpitis vary considerably among individuals, hindering effective research. In this study, we established a mouse model of pulpitis by accessing the pulp cavity, exposing the pulp to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and then filling the tooth. One day after surgery, we observed many necrotic tissues and extensive inflammatory exudate, including neutrophils, around the coronal cavity preparation. Additionally, we noted many more neutrophils and a small amount of chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates at the junction between inflamed and normal tissue. These findings indicated that our model can be used to explore the early stage of pulpitis. Ten days after surgery, we observed vacuolar degeneration in some fibroblasts and proliferation in others at the distal end of the inflamed tissue. We also noted dilation and congestion of the pulp blood vessels. Therefore, our model can also be used to explore the middle and later stages of pulpitis. Thirty days after surgery, we observed necrosis in the coronal pulp cavity and upper half of the root pulp, indicating that our model can also be used to explore the end stage of pulpitis. This model is easy to establish, shows pulpitis progression in the dental pulp, exhibits a clear inflammatory phenotype, and can be readily combined with gene editing techniques. Accordingly, it is suitable for basic research focused on pulpitis and has substantial practical value.",
    "problem": "The complexity and variability of pulpitis models in animals hinder effective research. Current models using dogs and miniature pigs are surgically complex, time-consuming, and difficult for gene editing, while existing mouse models often involve direct pulp exposure, which does not reflect diverse causes of pulpitis.",
    "method": "A mouse model of pulpitis was established by accessing the pulp cavity, exposing pulp to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and filling the tooth. Histopathological observations were conducted at 1, 10, and 30 days post-surgery to assess inflammation and tissue changes.",
    "innovation": "Simplified modeling process, clear progression of pulp inflammation stages (early, middle, late, and end stage), compatibility with gene editing techniques, and a phenotype that mimics clinical pulpitis progression.",
    "application": "Suitable for basic research on pulpitis, particularly for studying inflammation mechanisms, tissue degeneration, regeneration, and testing therapeutic interventions. It is adaptable to genetic studies due to ease of gene editing in mice.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression analysis is a fundamental technique to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of genes of interest or to reveal the patterns of plant response to environmental stimuli. Traditionally, gene expression analyses have required RNA extraction, followed by cDNA synthesis and qPCR analyses. However, this conventional method is costly and time-consuming, limiting the amount of data collected. The protocol outlined in this study, which utilizes a chemiluminescence system, offers a cost-effective and rapid method for assessing the expression of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes, exemplified by analyzing the nitrate-inducible expression of a major nitrate transporter gene, nitrate transporter 2.1 (NRT2.1). A reporter construct, containing the NRT2.1 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase gene, was introduced into wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis plants. Seeds obtained from the transgenic lines were grown for 3 days in 96-well microplates containing a nitrate-free nutrient solution. After 3 days, the nutrient solution was replaced with a fresh batch, which was supplemented with luciferin potassium. One hour later, nitrate was added at various concentrations, and the temporal expression pattern of NRT2.1 was analyzed by monitoring the chemiluminescence signals. This method allowed for the cost-effective, quantitative, and highthroughput analysis of NRT2.1 expression over time under the effects of various nutrient conditions and genetic backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Two aconitase isoforms are present in mammalian cells: the mitochondrial aconitase (ACO2) that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle, and the bifunctional cytosolic enzyme (ACO1), which also plays a role as an RNA-binding protein in the regulation of intracellular iron metabolism. Aconitase activities in the different subcellular compartments can be selectively inactivated by different genetic defects, iron depletion, and oxidative or nitrative stress. Aconitase contains a 4Fe-4S^2+ cluster that is essential for substrate coordination and catalysis. Many Fe-S clusters are sensitive to oxidative stress, nitrative stress, and reduced iron availability, which forms the basis of redox- and iron-mediated regulation of intermediary metabolism via aconitase and other Fe-S cluster-containing metabolic enzymes, such as succinate dehydrogenase. As such, ACO1 and ACO2 activities can serve as compartment-specific surrogate markers of oxygen levels, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), iron bioavailability, and the status of intermediary and iron metabolism. Here, we provide a protocol describing a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)-based procedure that has been successfully used to monitor ACO1 and ACO2 aconitase activities simultaneously in human and mouse cells and tissues.",

    "title": "Shipment of Cyanobacteria by Agarose Gel Embedding (SCAGE)—A Novel Method for Simple and Robust Delivery of Cyanobacteria",
    "abstract": "In modern science, the exchange of scientific material between different institutions and collaborating working groups constitutes an indispensable endeavor. For this purpose, bacterial strains are frequently shipped to collaborators to advance joint research projects. Bacterial strains are usually safely shipped as cultures on solid medium, whereas the shipment of liquid cultures requires specific safety measures due to the risk of leakage. Cyanobacterial cultures are frequently maintained as liquid stock cultures, and this problem typically arises. This protocol describes a new method for the shipment of liquid cyanobacterial stock cultures by agarose gel embedding (SCAGE). More specifically, a cyanobacterial culture is mixed with low-melting agarose and cast into sterile plastic bags, resulting in a thin, solid cyanobacterial agarose gel (cyanogel) that can be easily shipped. After delivery, subsequent regeneration of the cyanogel material in liquid media results in full recovery of the examined bacterial strains. Thus, the packaging method devised in the present study comprises an innovative technique to facilitate the shipment of bacterial strains, whilst eliminating previously encountered issues like cell culture leakage.",

    "abstract": "ALPK1 is an atypical protein kinase that is activated during bacterial infection by ADP-heptose and phosphorylates TIFA to activate a cell signaling pathway. In contrast, specific mutations in ALPK1 allow it to also be activated by endogenous human nucleotide sugars such as UDP-mannose, leading to the phosphorylation of TIFA in the absence of infection. This protocol describes a quantitative, cell-free phosphorylation assay that can directly measure the catalytic activity of wildtype and disease-causing ALPK1 in the presence of different nucleotide sugars. In this method, overexpressed ALPK1 is first immunoprecipitated from the extracts of ALPK1 knockout HEK-Blue cells transfected with plasmids encoding either FLAG-tagged wildtype or mutant ALPK1, and then subjected to a radioactive phosphorylation assay in which the phosphorylation of purified GST-tagged TIFA by ALPK1 is quantified by measuring the incorporation of radioactivity derived from radiolabeled ATP.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex network of proteins that provides structural support and biochemical cues to cells within tissues. Characterizing ECM composition is critical for understanding this tissue component’s roles in development, homeostasis, and disease processes. This protocol describes an integrated pipeline for profiling both cellular and ECM proteins across varied tissue types using mass spectrometry–based proteomics. The workflow covers stepwise extraction of cellular and extracellular proteins, enzymatic digestion into peptides, peptide cleanup, mass spectrometry analysis, and bioinformatic data processing. The key advantages include unbiased coverage of cellular, ECM-associated, and core-ECM proteins, including the fraction of ECM that cannot be solubilized using strong chaotropic agents such as urea or guanidine hydrochloride. Additionally, the method has been optimized for reproducible ECM enrichment and quantification across diverse tissue samples. This protocol enables systematic mapping of the ECM at a proteome-wide scale.",

    "title": "Development of a Rapid Epstein–Barr Virus Detection System Based on Recombinase Polymerase Amplification and a Lateral Flow Assay",
    "abstract": "The quality of cellular products used in biological research can impact the accuracy of results. Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a latent virus that spreads extensively worldwide, and cell lines used in experiments may carry EBV and pose an infection risk. The presence of EBV in a single cell line can contaminate other cell lines used in the same laboratory, affecting experimental results. Existing tests to detect EBV can be divided into three categories: nucleic acid assays, serological assays, and in situ hybridization assays. However, most methods are time-consuming, expensive, and not conducive to high-volume clinical screening. Therefore, a simple system that allows for the rapid detection of EBV in multiple contexts, including both cell culture and tissue samples, remains necessary. In our research, we developed EBV detection systems: (1) a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection system, (2) a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA)-based detection system, and (3) a combined RPA-lateral flow assay (LFA) detection system. The minimum EBV detection limits were 1×10^3 copy numbers for the RPA-based and RPA-LFA systems and 1×10^4 copy numbers for the PCR-based system. Both the PCR and RPA detection systems were applied to 192 cell lines, and the results were consistent with those of the assays specified in industry standards. A total of 10 EBV-positive cell lines were identified. The combined RPA-LFA system is simple to operate, allowing for rapid result visualization. This system can be implemented in laboratories and cell banks as part of a daily quality control strategy to ensure cell quality and experimental safety and may represent a potential new technique for the rapid detection of EBV in clinical samples.",
    "problem": "Need for a rapid, cost-effective, and high-throughput method to detect Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) in cell lines and tissue samples. Existing methods are time-consuming, expensive, and not suitable for large-scale screening, posing risks of contamination and experimental inaccuracy.",
    "method": "Development of three detection systems: (1) PCR-based, (2) RPA-based, and (3) a combined RPA-lateral flow assay (RPA-LFA) system. The systems were tested for sensitivity and applied to 192 cell lines to validate their accuracy compared to industry-standard assays.",
    "innovation": "The RPA-LFA system offers rapid, simple, and cost-effective detection with a sensitivity of 1×10^3 EBV copy numbers, faster visualization of results, and ease of operation. It outperforms the PCR-based system in sensitivity and accessibility.",
    "application": "Suitable for EBV detection in cell lines, tissue samples, and clinical settings. Ideal for laboratories and cell banks as part of a daily quality control strategy to ensure cell quality and experimental safety. Potential for clinical diagnostics.",

    "title": "A Simple, Rapid, and Cost-Effective Method for Assessing Carbohydrate Partitioning in Microalgae and Arabidopsis thaliana",
    "abstract": "Carbohydrates serve crucial functions in most living cells, encompassing structural and metabolic roles. Within the realms of plant and algal biology, carbohydrate biosynthesis and partitioning play pivotal roles in growth, development, stress physiology, and various practical applications. These applications span diverse fields, including the food and feed industry, bioenergetics (biofuels), and environmental management. However, existing methods for carbohydrate determination tend to be costly and time-intensive. In response to that, we propose a novel approach to assess carbohydrate partitioning from small samples. This method leverages the differential solubility of various fractions, including soluble sugars, starch, and structural polymers (such as cellulose). After fractionation, a straightforward spectrophotometric analysis allows for the quantification of sugars.",

    "input": "\n# Biological materials\n\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii represents a valuable research organism with a sequenced genome, simple life cycle, and ability to grow in multiple metabolic states. It is a model organism for studies in areas like flagella structure, chloroplast biogenesis, photosynthesis, and cell–cell recognition. Its cell wall is composed of glycoproteins and polysaccharides in a multi-layered structure. Strain CC125 represents a popular wild-type (WT) alga for the species; strain cw15 6 is a cell wall–deficient mutant that facilitates genetic manipulation and cellular process studies; and sta6 is a mutant strain deficient in starch accumulation, which is very useful for studies on carbon partitioning and lipid accumulation 7.\n\nScenedesmus obliquus and Chlorella sorokiniana are thoroughly used for biotechnological applications such as the production of biofuels and food/feed ingredients and wastewater treatment. They show very robust and prolific growth in cultivation facilities. In contrast to C. reinhardtii, they currently offer limited possibilities for genetic modification and reduced availability of mutant strains. While the S. obliquus cell wall comprises a resistant outer layer of algaenan and an inner layer of cellulosic material, the C. sorokiniana cell wall presents a thin trilaminate layer of hemicellulose and a glucosamine-based residue and produces mucilage 8.\n\nA. thaliana, a model organism in plant biology, boasts features like a small genome, rapid life cycle, and easy genetic modification. Its cell wall, composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin, provides strength, flexibility, and porosity. Some cells even develop a secondary cell wall with lignin for rigidity. Structural proteins, enzymes, and glycoproteins contribute to cell signaling and growth. Remodeling occurs during growth and in response to environmental stress 9.\n\nAll of these organisms produce starch as a carbon and energy reserve, and sugars with different physiological roles.\n\n# Organisms' cultivation conditions\n\nThe microalgal strains C. . reinhardtii CC125 (WT), cw15 (cell wall–deficient), and sta6 (starchless mutant) were kindly provided by C. Benning (Michigan State University), and strains C. . sorokiniana RP and S. obliquus C1S were isolated 10 and characterized 11 by our research group. These algal strains belong to the INBIOTEC culture collection.\n\nThe microalgal strains were cultivated and induced for carbohydrate accumulation as previously described in Bader et al. 12 under nitrogen-deficient conditions.\n\nThe A . thaliana used in this study was a wild type of Columbia (Col-O) stored in our laboratory. Seeds were sown in pots and grown under 16/8~h~ light/dark (light 120 umol photons m^-2s^-1 ) at 23~^°C in a growth room. Fourteenday-old A. thaliana plants were treated with 150mMNaCl for 14 days before leaves were collected for carbohydrate analysis.\n\n# Reagents\n\n1.  Distilled water dH_2O)\n2.

In the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid, carbohydrates are dehydrated into furfurals (or hydroxymethylfurfurals), which condense with anthrone (10-keto-9,10-dihydroxyanthracene) (Figure 1) to produce a blue-green complex. The intensity of the color is quantified by absorbance at 620nm .\n\n()\nFigure 1. Reaction of the anthrone assay. Modified from Gerwig 14.

    "abstract": "Droplet microfluidic platforms have been broadly used to facilitate DNA transfer in mammalian and bacterial hosts via methods such as transformation, transfection, and conjugation, as introduced in our previous work. Herein, we recapitulate our method for conjugal DNA transfer between Bacillus subtilis strains in a droplet for increased conjugation efficiency and throughput of an otherwise laborious protocol. By co-incubating the donor and recipient strains in droplets, our method confines cells into close proximity allowing for increased cell-to-cell interactions. This methodology is advantageous in its potential to automate and accelerate the genetic modification of undomesticated organisms that may be difficult to cultivate. This device is also designed for modularity and can be integrated into a variety of experimental workflows in which fine-tuning of donor-to-recipient cell ratios, growth rates, and media substrate concentrations may be necessary.",

    "title": "Display of Native SARS-CoV-2 Spike on Mammalian Cells to Measure Antibody Affinity and ADCC",
    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic led to the rapid development of antibody-based therapeutics and vaccines targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Several antibodies have been instrumental in protecting vulnerable populations, but their utility was limited by the emergence of spike variants with diminished susceptibility to antibody binding and neutralization. Moreover, these spike variants exhibited reduced neutralization by polyclonal antibodies in vaccinated individuals. Accordingly, the characterization of antibody binding to spike variants is critical to define antibody potency and understand the impact of amino acid changes. A key challenge in this effort is poor spike stability, with most current methods assessing antibody binding using individual domains instead of the intact spike or variants with stabilizing amino acid changes in the ectodomain (e.g., 2P or HexaPro). The use of non-native spike may not accurately predict antibody binding if changes lie within the epitope or alter epitope accessibility by altering spike dynamics. Here, we present methods to characterize antibody affinity for and activity against unmodified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variants displayed on a mammalian cell membrane that recapitulates the native spike environment on infected cells. These include a flow cytometry–based method to determine the effective antibody binding affinity (K_D) and an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay to assess Fc-mediated activities. These methods can readily evaluate antibody activity across a panel of spike variants and contribute to our understanding of spike/antibody co-evolution.",

Current methods often use non-native or stabilized spike proteins, which may not accurately reflect antibody binding to the native spike.",

    "abstract": "The planar lipid bilayer (PLB) technique represents a highly effective method for the study of membrane protein properties in a controlled environment. The PLB method was employed to investigate the role of mitochondrial inner membrane protein 17 (MPV17), whose mutations are associated with a hepatocerebral form of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDS). This protocol presents a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to the assembly and utilization of a PLB system. The procedure comprises the formation of a lipid bilayer over an aperture, the reconstitution of the target protein, and the utilization of electrophysiological recording techniques to monitor channel activity. Furthermore, recommendations are provided for optimizing experimental conditions and overcoming common challenges encountered in PLB experiments. Overall, this protocol highlights the versatility of the PLB technique in advancing our understanding of membrane protein function and its broad application in various fields of research.",

    "title": "A Protocol for co-Injecting Cells with Pulverized Fibers for Improved Cell Survival and Engraftment",
    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is crucial for medical applications such as tissue reconstruction, cosmetic procedures, and correcting soft tissue deformities. Significant advances in the use of adipose tissue have been achieved through Coleman’s studies in fat grafting, which gained widespread acceptance due to its effectiveness and safety. Despite its benefits, adipose tissue grafting faces several limitations, including high absorption rates due to insufficient support or anchorage, replacement by fibrous tissue, migration from the intended site, and loss of the initial desired morphology post-administration. To counteract these constraints, there is a need for improved grafting techniques that enhance the predictability and consistency of outcomes. Biomaterials are extensively used in tissue engineering to support cell adhesion, proliferation, and growth. Both natural and synthetic materials have shown promise in creating suitable microenvironments for adipose tissue regeneration. PLGA, a synthetic copolymer, is particularly notable for its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable mechanical properties. Here, we describe a protocol using milled electrospun poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) fibers combined with lipoaspirated tissue to create a fibrous slurry for injection. By pulverizing PLGA fiber mats to create fiber fragments with increased pore size and porosity, we can influence key cellular responses and enhance the success of adipose tissue–grafting procedures. This approach improves anchorage and support for adipocytes, thereby increasing cell viability. This method aims to enhance vascularity, perfusion, and volume retention in adipose tissue grafts, which addresses many of the limitations of current approaches to adipose tissue grafting and holds promise for more consistent and successful outcomes.",

    "title": "Preparing Chamber Slides With Pressed Collagen for Live Imaging Monolayers of Primary Human Intestinal Stem Cells",
    "abstract": "Primary human intestinal stem cells (ISCs) can be cultured and passaged indefinitely as two-dimensional monolayers grown on soft collagen. Culturing ISCs as monolayers enables easy access to the luminal side for chemical treatments and provides a simpler topology for high-resolution imaging compared to cells cultured as three-dimensional organoids. However, the soft collagen required to support primary ISC growth can pose a challenge for live imaging with an inverted microscope, as the collagen creates a steep meniscus when poured into wells. This may lead to uneven growth toward the center of the well, with cells at the edges often extending beyond the working distance of confocal microscopes. We have engineered a 3D-printed collagen mold that enables the preparation of chamber slides with flat, smooth, and reproducible thin collagen layers. These layers are adequate to support ISC growth while being thin enough to optimize live imaging with an inverted microscope. We present methods for constructing the collagen press, preparing chamber slides with pressed collagen, and plating primary human ISCs for growth and analysis.",

    "title": "A Simple Staining Method Using Pyronin Y for Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy to Evaluate Gelatin Cryogels",
    "abstract": "This study explores the novel application of pyronin Y for fluorescently labeling extracellular matrices (ECMs) and gelatin cryogels, providing a simple and reliable method for laser scanning confocal microscopy. Pyronin Y exhibited remarkable staining ability of the porous structures of gelatin cryogels, indicating its potential as a reliable tool for evaluating such biomaterials. Confocal imaging of pyronin Y–stained cryogels produced high signal-to-noise ratio images suitable for quantifying pores using Fiji/Image J. Importantly, pyronin Y enabled effective dual-color imaging of cryogel-labeled mesenchymal stem cells, expanding its utility beyond traditional RNA assays. Traditional staining methods like Mason’s trichrome and Sirius Red have limitations in cryogel applications. Pyronin Y emerges as a powerful alternative due to its water solubility, minimal toxicity, and stability. Our results demonstrate pyronin Y’s ability to specifically stain gelatin cryogel's porous structures, surpassing its weak staining of ECMs in 2D. Confocal imaging revealed enduring staining even under rigorous scanning, with no notable photobleaching observed. Furthermore, pyronin Y's combination with Alexa Fluor 647 for dual-color imaging showed promising results, validating its versatility in fluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, this study establishes pyronin Y as a cost-effective and rapid option for fluorescent staining of gelatin cryogels. Its simplicity, efficacy, and compatibility with confocal microscopy make it a valuable tool for characterizing and evaluating gelatin-based biomaterials, contributing significantly to the field of cryogel imaging. The study opens new avenues for dual-color imaging in biomaterial research and tissue engineering, advancing our understanding of cellular interactions within scaffolds.",

These functionalities can undergo bioorthogonal reactions, such as copper-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC), with small-molecule probes, enabling the tagging and visualization of biomolecules. This approach has greatly enhanced our understanding of cellular dynamics, enzyme targeting, and protein post-translational modifications. Herein, we report a protocol for preparing protein lysates for click reaction and in-gel fluorescence analysis, exemplified using alk-16, a terminal alkyne-functionalized stearic acid analog, to investigate proteins with fatty acylation.

    "title": "Measurement of the Activity of Wildtype and Disease-Causing ALPK1 Mutants in Transfected Cells With a 96-Well Format NF-κB/AP-1 Reporter Assay",
    "abstract": "Alpha-protein kinase 1 (ALPK1) is normally activated by bacterial ADP-heptose as part of the innate immune response, leading to the initiation of downstream signalling events that culminate in the activation of transcription factors such as NF- nablaKB and AP-1. In contrast, disease-causing mutations in ALPK1 that cause ROSAH syndrome or spiradenoma allow ALPK1 to be activated in cells in the absence of bacterial infection (i.e., without ADP-heptose). This protocol describes a semi-quantitative reporter assay based on ALPK1 knockout HEK-Blue cells that measures the activity of transfected wildtype and disease-causing forms of ALPK1 by virtue of their ability to activate the transcription factors NF- nablaKB and AP-1. These cells express a synthetic gene encoding alkaline phosphatase under the control of an NF-κB/AP-1-dependent promoter, and consequently, the activation of ALPK1 leads to the production of alkaline phosphatase, which is secreted into the culture media and can be measured colorimetrically at 645~nm after the addition of a detection reagent.",

    "title": "Small-Molecule Probe for Imaging Oxidative Stress–Induced Carbonylation in Live Cells",
    "abstract": "Protein carbonylation has been known as the major form of irreversible protein modifications and is also widely used as an indicator of oxidative stress in the biological environment. In the presence of oxidative stress, biological systems tend to produce large amounts of carbonyl moieties; these carbonyl groups do not have particular UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopic characteristics that we can differentiate, observe, and detect. Thus, their detection and quantification can only be performed using specific chemical probes. Commercially available fluorescent probes to detect specific carbonylation in biological systems have been used, but their chemical portfolio is still very limited. This  protocol  outlines  the  methods  and  procedures  employed  to  synthesize  a  probe,  (E,Z)-2-(2-(2- hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazonyl)-5-nitrophenol (2Hzin5NP), and assess its impact on carbonylation in human cells. The synthesis involves several steps, including the preparation of its hydrazone compounds mimicking cell carbonyls, 2-Hydrazinyl 5-nitrophenol, (E,Z)-2-(2-ethylidenehydrazonyl)-5-nitrophenol, and the final product (E,Z)- 2-(2-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazonyl)-5-nitrophenol.

    "abstract": "Lysosome-related organelles (LROs) are a class of heterogeneous subcellular organelles conserved in eukaryotes, performing various functions. An important function of LROs is to mediate phosphorus and metal homeostasis. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serves as a model organism for investigating metal ion metabolism. Considering that LROs contain polyphosphate and various metal elements, the purification strategy is based on their higher density by fractionating cell lysate through OptiPrep density gradient ultracentrifugation. Here, we optimized a method for purifying LROs from C. reinhardtii cells that have reached stationary phase (sta-LROs) or are overloaded with iron (Fe-LROs). Our protocol provides technical support for further investigations on the biogenesis and function of LROs in C. reinhardtii.",

    "abstract": "In plants, the first interaction between the pollen grain and the epidermal cells of the stigma is crucial for successful reproduction. When the pollen is accepted, it germinates, producing a tube that transports the two sperm cells to the ovules for fertilization. Confocal microscopy has been used to characterize the behavior of stigmatic cells postpollination 1, but it is time-consuming since it requires the development of a range of fluorescent marker lines. Here, we propose a quick, high-resolution imaging protocol using tabletop scanning electron microscopy. This technique does not require prior sample fixation or fluorescent marker lines. It effectively captures pollen grain behavior from early hydration (a few minutes after pollination) to pollen tube growth within the stigma (1 h after pollination) and is particularly efficient for tracking pollen tube paths.",

    "title": "Preparation of Polarity-Marked Microtubules Using a Plus-End Capping DARPin",
    "abstract": "The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is formed in part by microtubules, which are relatively rigid filaments with inherent structural polarity. One consequence of this polarity is that the two ends of a microtubule have different properties with important consequences for their cellular roles. These differences are often challenging to probe within the crowded environment of the cell. Fluorescence microscopy–based in vitro assays with purified proteins and stabilized microtubules have been used to characterize polarity-dependent and end-specific behaviors. These assays require ways to visualize the polarity of the microtubules, which has previously been achieved either by the addition of fluorescently tagged motor proteins with known directionality or by fluorescently polarity marking the microtubules themselves. However, classical polarity-marking protocols require a particular chemically modified tubulin and generate microtubules with chemically different plus and minus segments. These chemical differences in the segments may affect the behavior of interacting proteins of interest in an undesirable manner. We present here a new protocol that uses a previously characterized, reversibly binding microtubule plus-end capping protein, a designed ankyrin repeat protein (DARPin), to efficiently produce polarity-marked microtubules with different fluorescently labeled, but otherwise biochemically identical, plus- and minus-end segments.",

    "title": "Multiplex Genome Editing of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells Using Cpf1",
    "abstract": "Targeted genome editing of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is critical for basic and translational research and can be achieved with site-specific endonucleases. Cpf1 (CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella) is a programmable DNA endonuclease with AT-rich PAM sequences. In this protocol, we describe procedures for using a single vector system to deliver Cpf1 and CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for genome editing in hPSCs. This protocol enables indel formation and homologous recombination–mediated precise editing at multiple loci. With the delivery of Cpf1 and a single U6 promoter-driven guide RNA array composed of an AAVS1-targeting and a MAFB-targeting crRNA array, efficient multiplex genome editing at the AAVS1 (knockin) and MAFB (knockout) loci in hPSCs could be achieved in a single experiment. The edited hPSCs expressed pluripotency markers and could differentiate into neurons in vitro. This system also generated INS reporter hPSCs with a 6 kb cassette knockin at the INS locus. The INS reporter cells can differentiate into  -cells that express tdTomato and luciferase, permitting fluorescenceactivated cell sorting of hPSC-  -cells. By targeted screening of potential off-target sequences that are most homologous to crRNA sequences, no off-target mutations were detected in any of the tested sequences. This work provides an efficient and flexible system for precise genome editing in mammalian cells including hPSCs with the benefits of less off-target effects.",
    "problem": "Need for efficient and precise multiplex genome editing in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) for basic research and translational applications, while minimizing off-target effects and simplifying the delivery process.",
    "method": "Use of a single vector system delivering Cpf1 (CRISPR from Prevotella and Francisella) and a U6 promoter-driven guide RNA array for simultaneous editing of multiple loci in hPSCs, enabling both indel formation and homologous recombination-mediated precise editing.",
    "innovation": "Utilization of Cpf1 with AT-rich PAM sequences for targeted editing, efficient multiplex editing of multiple loci in a single experiment, reduced off-target effects, and compatibility with reporter gene knockin for functional screening and cell sorting.",
    "application": "Genome editing in hPSCs for basic and translational research, generation of reporter cell lines (e.g., INS reporter hPSCs), differentiation studies, and potential therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine.",

The protocol aims to enhance existing methodologies by offering precise and efficient evaluation of foam cells and LDAM burden in various neuropathological conditions linked to lipid metabolism and neuroinflammation. A notable challenge in analyzing tissue from mouse models of these neurodegenerative disorders is the interference caused by the autofluorescent molecule lipofuscin. Our protocol addresses this issue with specific steps that effectively distinguish BODIPY fluorescence from lipofuscin autofluorescence, using advanced imaging techniques and filter settings to ensure accurate and reliable analysis. By providing a straightforward and accessible method, this research aims to facilitate the broader adoption of BODIPY-based techniques for detailed foam cell and LDAM analysis in mouse brain tissue, potentially enhancing diagnostic capabilities and deepening our understanding of how these cells contribute to neurodegenerative disease mechanisms.",

    "title": "Accurate Measurement of Cell Number– Normalized Differential Gene Expression in Cells Treated With Retinoic Acid",
    "abstract": "Genome-wide gene expression analysis is a commonly used method to quantitatively examine the transcriptional signature of any tissue or cell state. Standard bulk cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) quantifies RNAs in the cells of the tissue type of interest through massive parallel sequencing of cDNA synthesized from the cellular RNA. The subsequent analysis of global RNA expression and normalization of RNA expression levels between two or more samples generally assumes that cells from all samples produce equivalent amounts of RNA per cell. This assumption may be invalid in cells where MYC or MYCN expression levels are markedly different and thus, overall mRNA expression per cell is altered. Here, we describe an approach for RNA-seq analysis of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells during treatment with retinoic acid, which causes dramatic downregulation of MYCN expression and induces growth arrest and differentiation of the cells. Our procedure employs spiked-in RNA standards added in ratio to the number of cells in each sample prior to RNA extraction. In the analysis of differential gene expression, the expression level of each gene is standardized to the spiked-in RNA standard to accurately assess gene expression levels per cell in conditions of high and low MYCN expression. Our protocol thus provides a stepby-step experimental approach for normalizing RNA-seq expression data on a per-cell-number basis, allowing accurate assessment of differential gene expression in cells expressing markedly different levels of MYC or MYCN.",

    "title": "PEPITA: Parallelized High-Throughput Quantification  of  Ototoxicity and Otoprotection in Zebrafish Larvae",
    "abstract": "Drug-induced hearing injury (ototoxicity) is a common, debilitating side effect of many antibiotic regimens that can be worsened by adverse drug interactions. Such adverse drug interactions are often not detected until after drugs are already on the market because of the difficulty of measuring all possible drug combinations. While in vivo mammalian assays to screen for ototoxic damage exist, they are currently time-consuming, costly, and limited in throughput, which limits their utility in assessing drug interaction outcomes. To facilitate more rapid quantification of ototoxicity and assessment of adverse drug interactions that impact ototoxicity, we have developed a highthroughput workflow we call parallelized evaluation of protection and injury for toxicity assessment (PEPITA). PEPITA uses zebrafish larvae to quantify ototoxic damage and protection. Previous work has shown that hair cells (HCs) in the zebrafish lateral line are very similar to human inner ear HCs, meaning zebrafish are a viable model to test drug-induced ototoxicity. In PEPITA, we expose zebrafish larvae to different combinations of drugs, fluorescently label the HCs, and subsequently use microscopy to quantify the brightness of the fluorescently labeled HCs as an assay for ototoxic damage and hair-cell viability. PEPITA is a reproducible, low-cost, technically accessible, and high-throughput assay. These advantages allow many experiments to be conducted in parallel, paving the way for systematic evaluation of drug-induced hearing injury and other multidrug interactions.",

    "title": "The on-Site Monitoring and SpecimenMaking of Ectoparasites on Rodents and Other Small Mammals",
    "abstract": "The ectoparasites of rodents and other small mammals usually involve five categories of arthropods—fleas, sucking lice, gamasid mites, chigger mites, and occasionally, ticks. These ectoparasites are medically important, serving as vectors for diseases such as plague, murine typhus, scrub typhus, forest encephalitis, Lyme disease, and other zoonoses. Field surveys, collection, and specimen preparation of ectoparasites are crucial for studying taxonomy, faunistics, ecology, and epidemiology. They are also essential for vector surveillance. The present protocol summarizes the on-site monitoring and specimen-making of ectoparasites of rodents and other sympatric small mammals. Besides the collection and specimen preparation of small mammal hosts, the protocol describes in detail the collection, fixation, specimen-making, and taxonomic identification of ectoparasites and provides some monitoring indices. The on-site monitoring indices include the host density index and the infestation indices of ectoparasites (prevalence, mean abundance, mean intensity). The methodologies outlined in this protocol provide technical guidance and references for vector monitoring (surveillance) and control.",

    "title": "Fluorescent Staining and Quantification of Starch Granules in Chloroplasts of Live Plant Cells Using Fluorescein",
    "abstract": "Plants use C O_2 , water, and light energy to generate carbohydrates through photosynthesis. During daytime, these carbohydrates are polymerized, leading to the accumulation of starch granules in chloroplasts. The catabolites produced by the degradation of these chloroplast starch granules are used for physiological responses and plant growth. Various staining methods, such as iodine staining, have previously been used to visualize the accumulation of chloroplast starch granules; however, these staining methods cannot be used to image live cells and/or provide confocal images with non-specific signals. In this study, we developed a new imaging method for the fluorescent observation of chloroplast starch granules in living plant cells by staining with fluorescein, a widely available fluorescent dye. This simple staining method, which involves soaking a leaf disk in staining solution, shows high specificity in confocal images. Fluorescent images of the stained tissue allow the cellular starch content of living cells to be quantified with the same level of accuracy as a conventional biochemical method (amyloglucosidase/α- amylase method). Fluorescein staining thus not only enables the easy and clear observation of chloroplast starch granules but also allows for precise quantification in living cells.",

    "application": "Suitable for studying starch accumulation in living plant cells, applicable in plant physiology research, and useful for real-time monitoring of starch dynamics during photosynthesis.",

    "title": "Semi-Automated Assessment of LongTerm Olfactory Habituation in Drosophila melanogaster Using the Olfactory Arena",
    "abstract": "Long-lasting memories are a core aspect of an animal’s life. Such memories are characterized by unique molecular mechanisms and often unique circuitry, neither of which are completely understood in vivo. The deep knowledge of the identity and connectivity of neurons of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, as well as the sophisticated genetic tools that allow in vivo perturbations and physiology monitoring, make it a remarkably useful organism in which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of long-term memories. In this protocol, we focus on habituation, a nonassociative form of learning, and describe a reliable, semi-automated technique to induce and assess long-term olfactory habituation (LTH) in Drosophila using the olfactory arena, thus providing a method aligned with recent technological progress in behavioral measurement. Prior work has shown that LTH is induced by a 4-day exposure to an odorant and is characterized by a long-lasting (>24h) reduction in behavioral response to the exposed odorant, measured using a manual and skill-intensive Y-maze assay. Here, we present a semi-automated protocol for obtaining quantifiable measures of LTH, at the level of detail required for other investigators in the field. Unlike previously described methods, the protocol presented here provides quantitative and detailed behavioral measurements obtained by video recording that can be shared with the scientific community and allows sophisticated forms of offline analysis. We suggest that this procedure has the potential to advance our understanding of molecular and circuit mechanisms of olfactory habituation, its control via neuromodulation, and its interactions with other forms of memory.",

Additionally, we developed an odor delivery system where saturated odor vapor can be independently delivered to two diagonally opposing quadrants (Figure 1). Two mass flow controllers ensured a constant flow rate of 100~mL/min in each quadrant. The airflow then converged to a central hole of the arena and was extracted at 400mL/min with a vacuum pump. Odors were delivered to the arena by rapidly diverging the airflow stream to selected odor vials using solenoid valves. Experimenters could choose among three different odors to be delivered on two diagonally opposite quadrants of the arena.\n\n()\n\nFigure 1. Schematic of the odor delivery system. Saturated odor stream, produced by bubbling the air stream through a selected odor vial (e.g., Odor 1) can be independently delivered to two diagonally opposing quadrants. The air stream can be rapidly diverged to odor vials 2 and 3 by simultaneously opening two solenoid valves (V1 and V2 or V1 and V3, respectively). A constant flow rate of 200mL/min on each odor line is ensured by two mass flow controllers. This flow bifurcates prior to entering the arena such that each quadrant receives a constant flow rate of 100mL/min . The airflow then converges to a central hole of the arena and is extracted at 400mL/min with a vacuum pump. Valves are energized using a 12V power supply via CoolDriveSolo valve drivers. Open and close commands are sent from the computer to the valves through an Arduino.\n\n1.  Connect each mass flow controller to solenoid valves (V1) using odor-inert PTFE tubing and connectors, as shown in Figure 2A and B. Push the 1/4\" OD (outer diameter) tubing through the push connector of the mass flow controller. Then, using a different diameter straight connector, attach one end of the 1/8\" OD tubing to this connector and the other end to the common port of the 3-way valves using the flangeless fittings (Figure 2B).\n2.  Connect 3-way solenoid valves and odor vials (odor vial 1). Attach one end of the 1/8\" OD PTFE tubing to the normally open port of the 3-way valve using the flangeless fittings and pass the other end of the tubing through the odor bottle screw cap with the insert, making sure the tubing is close to the bottom of the odor vial (Figure 2C). Push a separate piece of tubing through the second screw cap and insert, ensuring the end protrudes slightly from the odor vial lid. Connect the other end of this last tube to the manifold using the flangeless fittings. We obtained similar success using either SCHOTT Duran bottles with lids or scintillation vials with rubber caps as odor vials.\n3.  To allow diversion of the air stream to other odor vials, connect the normally closed port of the 3-way valve with two 2-way valves (V2 and V3) by using a T connector to bifurcate the odor stream onto the two 2-way valves (Figure 2D). Connect the 2-way solenoid valves and odor vials (odor vial 2 and 3) as explained above, then connect the output tubing from odor vials with the manifold (Figure 2E). Each manifold can be connected to up to four different odor vials. Use a fitting plug to block the unused manifold port.\n4.  Attach the odor inert flexible tubing TYGON SE200 1/16\" ID (inside diameter) to the output port of the manifold. Use the luer to thread and the male luer fittings to attach the tubing (Figure 2E). Then, connect the other end of the tubing to two opposing quadrants, first by bifurcating the tubing into two using a Y connector (Figure 2F) and then by attaching each of the two tube ends to the barbed fittings at two diagonally opposite quadrants of the arena (Figure 2K).\n5.  Connect the arena’s vacuum fitting and the flow meter using a TYGON SE200 flexible tubing (1/8\" ID) and a male barbed fitting (Figure 2G–H), then connect the flow meter to the pump. Finally, direct the pump output to an extractor to prevent odor accumulation in the room.\n6.  Cut a piece of red and black hookup wire. Connect one end of each wire to the 12V power supply and the other end to the CoolDriveSolo multi-board (Figure 2I). Make sure there are no exposed wires outside the mount\n\nhousing. Insert the CoolDrive valve controller driver on the multi-board (Figure 2J). You will need as many drivers as valves, which means 6 in our case; each board allows independent operation of up to eight solenoid valves. Connect the two wires of the valve to the CoolDriveSolo multi-board. Connect the CoolDriveSolo multi-board to the Arduino via insulated breadboard jumper wires, then plug the Arduino with the computer.\n\n7.  Place a high-resolution camera with a lens above the arena to record behavior and plug it into the computer with a USB 3.0 cable (Figure 2K). A custom-made infra-red LED panel and LED controller, made as described by the Janelia Farm Tech-Transfer office 20, is used as a light source. A desktop Windows PC with at least 8 GB RAM is needed for managing the experimental session and controlling the camera, valves, and LED panel.\n8.  The arena and associated odor delivery system should be placed in a climate box covered with a blackout cloth. We highly recommend checking all the connections for potential air leakage before operating the arena for the first time. From our experience, the most common source of air leakage is the Duran bottles used to contain the odors. Ensure that the bottles are evenly closed and use PTFE tread seal tape around the neck of the Duran bottles to avoid air leakage. While checking that connections are tight, make sure that you do not overtighten the connections with the solenoid valves—they are made of soft Teflon and can easily be damaged if overtightened.\n\n()\nFigure 2. Odor delivery assembly steps. (A) Add a mass flow controller to the odor delivery system by\n\npushing one end of the PTFE tubing through the push connector. (B) Connect the mass flow controller with the common port of the 3-way valve, and then connect the normally open port with odor vial 1. Valve wires will be connected to the MultiBoard as described further ahead in panel I. (C) Connection to odor vial #1 is established by passing the tubing through a screw cap and an insert. Make sure the input tubing is close to the bottom of the odor vial. (D) Using three separate pieces of tubing and a T connector, bifurcate the output from the normally closed port of the 3-way valve, and connect them with two 2-way valves. Each of the 2-way valves will then be connected to odor vials #2 and #3 . (E and F) Connect the output from odor vials #1, #2, and #3 to individual ports of the manifold, and then connect the output port with the arena, making sure to use a Y connector to bifurcate the odor flow into two and then connecting each tubing end to diagonally opposed odor inputs in the arena. (G and H) Connect the arena vacuum fitting with a flow meter using a flexible and odorinert piece of tubing, then connect the flow meter output with the vacuum pump using a separate piece of flexible tubing. (I) Plug the 12V power supply wires in the MultiBoard, as well as the two valve wires from each valve. A total of six valves will be connected to the board (two 3-way valves and four 2-way valves). (J) Insert six valve drivers in the board, one for each valve, and then use insulated breadboard jumper wires to connect each driver to the Arduino. You will need an extra wire for ground connection. (K) After assembling the odor delivery, place an LED board below the arena and plug the LED controller for illumination. Insert a high-resolution camera and a lens on top of the arena for video recording.\n\n",

    "title": "Novel Cross-Species Salivary GlandParasympathetic Neuron Coculture System",
    "abstract": "The parasympathetic nervous system is essential for salivary gland development and functionality. Parasympathetic neuron (parasymN) innervation is the main neural network that controls salivary secretion. Therefore, an exclusive model to study parasympathetic neurons and salivary gland tissue circuitry will significantly improve the understanding of the role of parasymN activation on salivary regulation. Harvesting primary rodent parasymNs is challenging due to their body-wide disbursed location. Similarly, the salivary glands are distributed in various locations around and within the oral cavity. Here, we present a coculture model system using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived parasymNs and primary mouse von Ebner’s gland cells. We previously reported the first protocol to robustly generate human parasymNs from hPSCs through the Schwann cell precursor (SCP) lineage. The hPSCparasymNs are functional and have been applied to model several autonomic disorders. We also used a Sox10- Cre::tdTomato (hereafter referred to as RFP) reporter mouse line, which labeled von Ebner’s glands, a type of minor salivary gland connected to the trough of circumvallate and foliate taste papillae. This labeling allowed for visualization and efficient isolation of primary tissues in young adult mice (8–10 weeks). By coculturing the two tissues, human parasymNs control mouse salivary gland cell growth and activation. Both parasymNs and primary salivary gland cells can be frozen and stocked at early stages of differentiation and isolation, making applications easier. This novel coculture model system could also be used to model and study related human diseases in the future, such as dry mouth syndrome.",
